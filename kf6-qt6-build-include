# Module definitions for building KDE Frameworks 6 and everything that depends on it
# (cmake, frameworks, workspace, applications)

# Usage: Write your own kdesrc-buildrc with only a "global" section
# (including "branch-group kf5-qt5")
# then include this file, like this:
#
# include kf6-qt6-build-include
# (or use a full path)
#
# You can then add additional modules if desired.

include kf6-frameworks-build-include
include kf6-workspace-build-include
include kf6-applications-build-include
include kf6-kdepim-build-include
