# Module definitions for building KDE Frameworks 6 and everything that depends on it
# (cmake, frameworks, workspace, applications)

# Usage: Write your own kdesrc-buildrc with only a "global" section
# (including "branch-group kf6-qt6")
# then include this file, like this:
#
# include kf6-qt6-build-include
# (or use a full path)
#
include kf6-common-options-build-include


# You can then add additional modules if desired.
include custom-qt6-libs-build-include 
include kf6-frameworks-build-include
include kf6-workspace-build-include
include kf6-applications-build-include
include kf6-kdepim-build-include

# Uncomment the following to include some specific extragear modules
# (you can instead add the ones you want to your main kdesrc-buildrc)
#include kf6-extragear-build-include

# or simply pull in all possible extragear and playground modules.
#module-set
    #repository kde-projects
    #use-modules extragear playground
#end module-set
