# This file should be used for any module options that should be set by default
# for any kdesrc-build users if they build a given module.

# Even if the user doesn't use the other kf6-*-build-include files,
# kdesrc-build can find the modules if include-dependencies is set and may need
# to have the right options set to do the right thing.
