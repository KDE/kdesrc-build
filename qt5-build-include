# It has unusually complex source codes which require a lot of memory to compile..

# This module will eat a *ton* of RAM and can lockup your system if you have a
# lot of CPU cores. qtwebengine uses a lower number of cores to compile by
# default but you can change the setting to -j here (or in your global options)
# to change that.
