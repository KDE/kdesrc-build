# qtwebengine is essentially the Chromium Embedded Framework with Qt bindings
# and has source code of unusually large complexity for the compiler.
# TL;DR: This will eat a *ton* of RAM and can lockup your system if you have a
# lot of CPU cores. qtwebengine is disabled by default but if you enable it
# also ensure you don't outstrip your available RAM with too high of a
# parallelism (-j flag).
