kdesrc-build is intended to build KDE-based software from its source repository, although it can build
other types of software from its native source control system(s) as well.

This documentation is intended for developers to aid in hacking on kdesrc-build itself, or porting the same concepts
to other build systems if necessary.

== Concepts

Some basic concepts are assumed throughout for brevity.

=== Modules

kdesrc-build uses the "module" as the most granular level of buildable
software. Each module has a name, unique in the list of all modules.
Each module can have a specific source control system plugin (Git,
KDE's git, Subversion, etc.) and a build system plugin (qmake, CMake, KDE's
CMake, autotools, etc.)

=== Build Phases

A module's build process progresses through build phases, which are often
optional.

The normal progression is:

. Update
. Uninstall (not normally seen)
. Build system setup and configuration
. Build
. Testsuite (if enabled)
. Install

The update phase can happen concurrently with other modules' build/install
phases, under the theory that the build phase is usually CPU-heavy so it makes
sense to start on subsequent network (IO-heavy) updates while the build
progresses.

=== Build Context

To group global settings and status together that exist across individual
modules, a "build context" is used, shared across the entire application.

Each module can refer to the global build context.

=== Configuration file (rc-file)

kdesrc-build uses a configuration file (usually abbreviated the `+rc-file+`) to
store:

. The list of modules to build, and
. The dependency order in which to build modules (the order seen in the rc-file), and
. The build or configuration options to use by default or on a per-module
basis.

When kdesrc-build is run, it will use `+kdesrc-buildrc+` located in the current
working directory. If this file is not present, the global rc-file at
`+~/.config/kdesrc-build/kdesrc-buildrc+`
(`+$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/kdesrc-build/kdesrc-buildrc+`, if `+XDG_CONFIG_HOME+`
environment variable is set) is used instead.

If neither of above is found, kdesrc-build will fallback to `+~/.kdesrc-buildrc+`.
This location is checked only for backward compatibility; it is advised to move
the configuration file to the XDG compliant path instead.

=== Command line

kdesrc-build uses the command line (seen as "cmdline" in the source and commit
logs) to override the list of modules to build (nearly always still requiring
that any modules built are visible from the rc-file). The command line is also
used to override various options (such as skipping source update phases),
control output verbosity and so on.

In theory every option in the rc-file can be set from the cmdline, and cmdline
entries override and mask any options used by default or read from an rc-file.

=== Module Sets

With the adoption of git, KDE exploded to having hundreds of repositories. It
would be annoying and error-prone to try to manually update the rc-file with
the list of modules to build and the proper ordering.

Because of this, kdesrc-build supports grouping modules into "module sets" of
modules that have common options and a common repository URL prefix, as if the
user had manually entered those modules one by one.

NOTE: This is controlled by the `+git-repository-base+` option to set the URL
prefix, the `+repository+` option to choose one of the defined bases, and the
`+use-modules+` option to list module names.

==== KDE module sets

To support the KDE repositories in particular, a special module set repository
is defined, `+kde-projects+`. Use of this repository enables some extra magic
in the modules that are ultimately defined from such a module set, including
automagic dependency handling and inclusion of modules based on a virtual KDE
project structure.

NOTE: Inclusion of modules is **separate** from dependency handling, which is
also supported!

=== Pretend mode

The user can pass a `+--pretend+` cmdline flag to have kdesrc-build not
actually undertake the more time or resource intensive actions, so that the
user can see what kdesrc-build would do and tweak their cmdline until it looks
correct, and then remove the --pretend flag from there.

This significantly influences the design of the script, both in action and
output.

=== Logs and build output

All build commands are logged to a file (see `+log_command+` in ksb::Util).
This is both to declutter the terminal output and to enable troubleshooting
after a build failure.

The logs are generally kept in a separate directory for each separate run of
kdesrc-build.  A "latest" symlink is created for each module name, which points
to the last instance of a script run.

If a build ends in a failure, an error.log symlink is created in the specific
log directory for that module, which points to the specific build phase output
file where the build was determined to have failed.

Sometimes there is no log though (e.g. an internal kdesrc-build failure outside
of log_command)!

Some users prefer to have TTY output. For now the --debug cmdline option is
useful for that, but --debug has a significant amount of other changes as well.

== Basic flow

For each script execution, kdesrc-build generically goes through the following
steps:

. Read the cmdline to determine global options, list of module *selectors*
(modules are defined later) and potentially alternate rc-files to use.
. Opens the selected rc-file (chosen on cmdline or based on `+$PWD+`) and reads
in the list of modules and module-sets in the rc-file along with the options
chosen for each.
. Ensures that the KDE git repository metadata is available (containing
dependency information and the virtual project path hierarchy)
. If module selectors are available from the cmdline, creates the build list by
expanding those selectors into the appropriate modules from the rc-file. If no
selectors, uses all module sets and modules from the rc-file.
  * Either mode can involve resolving dependencies for KDE-based modules.
. Forks additional children to serve as a way to perform updates and build in
separate processes so that they may proceed concurrently. Once ready, performs
these two steps concurrently:
.. Updates each module in order, and
.. Performs remaining module build steps in order (waiting for the update if
  needed).
. When all update/build processes are done, displays the results to the user.
