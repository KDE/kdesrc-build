# Sample configuration file for kdesrc-build.
#
# To use this sample configuration file, copy it to ~/.kdesrc-buildrc, and then
# edit it to suit your desires.
#
# Also see the included kdesrc-build-setup script, which will ask some
# questions and then generate a config. You can still refer to this file for
# additions.

# Global settings go in this section.  They apply to every module unless
# overridden later.
global

# This is the directory that your KDE sources are downloaded to.  This
# directory also holds the build and log directories by default.
#	source-dir ~/kdesrc

# This is the directory that KDE will end up installed at.  The default is
# appropriate for a single-user installation of KDE, which requires no root
# permissions.  If you'd like, you can install and use the sudo program to
# install KDE anywhere on your system, in conjunction with the
# make-install-prefix option.
#	kdedir ~/kde
#
# This is the Qt installation to use for building/using KDE. The default is
# to build Qt (see the qt module below). If you wish to use your system's
# installed Qt (assuming it is recent enough!) then you can leave this unset.
#	qtdir ~/qt4  # Default to installing Qt

# By default, each source code module is checked out from its latest
# development version ('master' for git, 'trunk' for subversion).
# If instead you want to check out another branch, like 4.7, use
#	branch KDE/4.7

# Note that some modules have their own special branch names that don't
# necessarily have the same meaning for other modules.
#
# Because of this, a better option might be to use the "branch-group" option,
# which automatically selects the right branch for supported modules (ones
# which use the kde-projects repository).
#
# kdesrc-build now must implicitly select a branch-group for KDE modules if
# you don't pick one... so it's better for you to pick one to make sure you
# get what you want!
#
# There are three branch groups,
# - stable-qt4 (the last KDE 4 release, plus bugfixes),
# - latest-qt4 (the upcoming KDE 4 release), and
# - kf5-qt5 (the Qt5-based KDE Frameworks 5 under development).
	branch-group latest-qt4

# This is the Subversion server to download the rest of the KDE sources from.
# Developers should uncomment this line, non-developers can leave it alone to use
# the anonymous mirrors.
#	svn-server svn+ssh://svn@svn.kde.org/home/kde

# cmake-options controls the compilation options for building KDE 4 modules.
# These options apply to all KDE modules unless otherwise specified.
#
# Also see https://techbase.kde.org/Development/Tutorials/CMake#Command_Line_Variables
#	cmake-options -DKDE4_BUILD_TESTS:BOOL=ON
	cmake-options -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo

# These are the default options passed to the make command.  The default tries
# to build with 2 parallel compiles.  If you are using distcc or have SMP, you
# should experiment with setting this value higher for best performance.
#	make-options -j2

# If you would like install KDE to the system (DO NOT INSTALL *over* a prior
# installation!), then you'll probably need to use sudo to install everything.
#
# The -S parameter causes sudo to read from standard input (which is redirected
# by kdesrc-build).  This means that if sudo has to ask for your password, it
# will fail, you need to configure sudo to be able to run "make install"
# without requesting a password.
#
# In addition, you can run kdesrc-build --no-install, and then
# sudo kdesrc-build --install if you are unable to configure sudo to allow
# make install with no password.
#	 make-install-prefix sudo -S

# purge-old-logs controls whether old log files should be removed after the
# latest build finishes. Set to false to disable it.
#	 purge-old-logs false
#

# For the full list of options please see
# https://docs.kde.org/trunk5/en/extragear-utils/kdesrc-build/conf-options-table.html

# qt is the default name of the module used to build the Qt toolkit, which is
# required for KDE. It is sometimes required to use the latest Qt available
# to build KDE. 2 versions are supported by kdesrc-build:
# 1. Qt Projects's Qt with no modifications.
# 2. A KDE copy with no modifications (but on a better git server).
#
# The Qt buildsystem is different from that used by KDE modules, and so
# settings from the global section will not apply to Qt.

# may become inconsistent with these sample flags.
# Do not specify -prefix, kdesrc-build will handle that.
#
# Phonon note:
# - If you compile phonon separately, make sure to pass -no-phonon.
# - Alternatively, if you use Qt's phonon, remove "phonon" from the use-modules
#   option in the module-set below.
# - As of KDE 4.6/Qt 4.7 the "right answer" is the first option: separate phonon.

# You can see the available branches by looking first on gitorious.org,

# Note that Nokia's own Qt repository does not recommend using the master

# Next is shown a "module-set", which is a grouping of modules that has special
# handling of the "repository" option (the module name is automatically added
# to the end for every module defined in this set), and accepts the special
# use-modules option to determine what modules are included in the group.
# Any other options included as defined for every module in the set.
# For every single module passed, kdesrc-build will create the appropriate
# "module" option, with the right repository setting (base + module name).
#
# If you need to set more options for only individual modules, you can add a
# module <name> ... end module as normal after the module-set, but keep in mind
# if you do this that you won't change the order the modules are built in.
#
