# Module definitions for building KDE Workspace 5

# Usage: Write your own kdesrc-buildrc with only a "global" section
# (including "branch-group kf5-qt5")
# then include this file, like this:
#
# include extragear/utils/kdesrc-build/kf5-frameworks-build-include
# include extragear/utils/kdesrc-build/kf5-applications-build-include
# (or using full paths)
#
# You can then add additional modules if desired.
#
# This file uses "branch groups" to decide which git branch to use. If you
# want to add your application here please be sure to update
# kde-build-metadata repo's "logical-module-structure". It includes a simple
# tool you can use to validate your change works (or just "kdesrc-build -p
# your-module" and look for the right branch).

module-set kf5-workspace-modules
    repository kde-projects # Required for branch-group

    # Compile everything under kde/workspace
    use-modules workspace

    # kdesrc-build can build dependencies (that it knows about) even if you forget
    # to list them all, if you uncomment this line.

    ignore-modules kwindowsaddons
    # This module doesn't have a buildsystem

    ignore-modules plasma5support
end module-set

# Update this module but don't install it, it requires write access to /usr
# Left here instead of kf5-common-options-build-include as it is already tied
# to the rest of these workspace modules.

# For some reason kwalletmanager is in kde/kdeutils, but is considered par of workspace
