<title>What is &kdesrc-build;?</title>

<para>
&kdesrc-build; is a script to help the &kde; community install <ulink
url="https://www.kde.org/">&kde;</ulink> software from its <ulink
url="https://git-scm.com/">&git;</ulink> source repositories,
and continue to update that software afterwards.
It is particularly intended to support those who need to supporting testing and
development of &kde; software, including users testing bugfixes and developers
working on new features.
</para>

<para>The &kdesrc-build; script can be configured to maintain a single individual
module, a full &plasma; desktop with &kde; application set, or somewhere in between.
</para>

<para>To get started, see <xref linkend="getting-started"/>, or continue reading for more
detail on how &kdesrc-build; works and what is covered in this documentation.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="operation-in-a-nutshell">
<title>&kdesrc-build; operation <quote>in a nutshell</quote></title>

<para>&kdesrc-build; works by using the tools available to the user at the
command-line, using the same interfaces available to the user. When
&kdesrc-build; is run, the following sequence is followed: </para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>&kdesrc-build; reads in the <link linkend="cmdline">command
line</link> and <link linkend="configure-data">configuration file</link>, to
determine what to build, compile options to use, where to install,
&etc;</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>&kdesrc-build; performs a source update for each <link
linkend="module-concept">module</link>. The update continues until all modules
have been updated. Modules that fail to update normally do not stop the build
&ndash; you will be notified at the end which modules did not
update.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Modules that were successfully updated are built, have their
test suite run, and are then installed.  To reduce the overall time spent,
&kdesrc-build; will by default start building the code as soon as the first
module has completed updating, and allow the remaining updates to continue
behind the scenes.
</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<tip><para>A <emphasis>very good</emphasis> overview of how &kde; modules are

<chapter id="getting-started">
<title>Getting Started</title>

<para>
In this chapter, we show how to use the &kdesrc-build; to checkout modules from
the &kde; repository and build them. We also provide a basic explanation of the
&kde; source code structure and the steps you have to perform before running
the script.
</para>

<para>
All topics present in this chapter are covered with even more detail in the
<ulink url="https://community.kde.org/Guidelines_and_HOWTOs/Build_from_source">
Build from Source</ulink> article, at the
<ulink url="https://community.kde.org/">&kde; Community Wiki</ulink>.
If you are compiling &kde; for the first time, it is a good idea to read
it, or consult it as a reference source. You will find detailed information
about packaging tools and requirements, common compilation pitfalls and
strategies and information about running your new &kde; installation.
</para>

<sect1 id="before-building">
<title>Preparing the System to Build &kde;</title>

<sect2 id="before-building-users">
<title>Setup a new user account</title>

<para>
It is recommended that you use a different user account to build, install,
and run your &kde; software from, since less permissions are required, and
to avoid interfering with your distribution's packages.
If you already have &kde; packages installed, the best choice
would be to create a different (dedicated) user to build and run the new &kde;.
</para>

<tip><para>Leaving your system &kde; untouched also allows you to have an
emergency fallback in case a coding mistake causes your latest software build
to be unusable.
</para></tip>

<para>
You can do also setup to install to a system-wide directory (&eg; <filename
class="directory">/usr/src/local</filename>) if you wish. This document
does not cover this installation type, since we assume you know what you are doing.
</para>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="before-building-preparation">
<title>Ensure your system is ready to build &kde; software</title>

<para>Before using the &kdesrc-build; script (or any other building
strategy) you must install the development tools and libraries needed for &kde;.
The nearly complete list of required tools can be found from
the <ulink url="https://community.kde.org/Guidelines_and_HOWTOs/Build_from_source#Install_required_devel_packages">&kde;
Community Wiki Build Requirements</ulink> page.
</para>

<para>Here is a list of some of the things you will need:</para>
<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>You will need &cmake;, this software is what &kde; uses to handle
build-time configuration of the source code and generation of the specific build
commands for your system.  The required version will vary
depending on what versions of &kde; software you are building (see TechBase for
specifics), but with modern distributions the &cmake; included with your distribution
should be quite sufficient.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>You must also install the source control clients needed to checkout
the &kde; source code. This means you need at least the following:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>The <ulink url="https://git-scm.com/">Git
source control manager</ulink>, which is used for all &kde; <ulink
url=" https://commits.kde.org/">source code</ulink></para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Although it is not required, the <ulink
url="http://bazaar.canonical.com/">Bazaar</ulink> source control manager is
used for a single module (libdbusmenu-qt) that is required for the &kde;
libraries. Most users can install this library through their distribution
packages but &kdesrc-build; supports building it as well if you desire. But to
build libdbusmenu-qt, you must have Bazaar installed.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist></listitem>

<listitem><para>The Perl scripting language is required for &kdesrc-build;, some &kde;
repositories, and &Qt; (if you build that from source).</para>

<para>The Perl that comes with your distribution should be suitable (it needs to be at
least Perl 5.14), but you will also need some additional modules (&kdesrc-build;
will warn if they are not present):</para>

<itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para>IO::Socket::SSL</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>JSON::PP or JSON::XS</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>YAML::PP, YAML::XS, or YAML::Syck</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</listitem>

<listitem><para>You will need a full C++ development environment (compiler, standard library, runtime,
and any required development packages).  The minimum required versions vary based on the &kde; module:
the &kde; Frameworks 5 collection supports the oldest compilers, while &kde; Plasma 5 and &kde; Applications
tend to require more recent compilers.</para>
<para>The GCC 4.8 or Clang 4 compilers are the minimum recommended.  Many distributions support easily
installing these tools using a <quote>build-essentials</quote> package, an option to install
"build dependencies" with &Qt;, or similar features.  The KDE Community Wiki has a page <ulink url="https://community.kde.org/Guidelines_and_HOWTOs/Build_from_source/Install_the_dependencies">tracking
recommended packages for major distributions</ulink>.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para>You will need a build tool that actually performs the
compilation steps (as generated by &cmake;). GNU Make is recommended and should
be available through your package manager. &cmake; does support others options, such
as the &ninja; build tool, which can be used by &kdesrc-build; using the
<link linkend="conf-custom-build-command">custom-build-command</link> configuration file
option.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Finally, you will need the appropriate &Qt; libraries (including development packages)
for the version of &kde; software you are building.  &kdesrc-build; does not officially support building &Qt; 5 (the current major version), so it is recommended to use your distribution's development packages or to
see the KDE Community wiki page on <ulink url="https://community.kde.org/Guidelines_and_HOWTOs/Build_from_source/OwnQt5">self-building Qt 5</ulink>.
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<note><para>Most operating system distributions include a method of easily
installing required development tools. Consult the Community Wiki page <ulink
url="https://community.kde.org/Guidelines_and_HOWTOs/Build_from_source#Install_required_devel_packages"
>Required devel packages</ulink> to see
if these instructions are already available.</para></note>

<important><para>
Some of these packages are divided into libraries (or programs or utilities),
and development packages. You will need at least the program or library
<emphasis>and</emphasis> its development package.
</para></important>

<para>
The &kde; developers make frequent changes to &kdesrc-build; to keep it in
sync with advances in &kde; development, including improvements to the
recommended &kdesrc-build; configuration, added modules, improving &cmake;
flags, &etc;</para>

<para>Because of this, we recommend obtaining &kdesrc-build; directly from its
source repository and then periodically updating it.</para>

<para>You can obtain &kdesrc-build; from its source repository by running:</para>
<programlisting>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput><command>git <option>clone</option> <option>https://invent.kde.org/sdk/kdesrc-build.git</option> <option><filename class="directory"><replaceable>~/kdesrc-build</replaceable></filename></option></command></userinput>
</programlisting>

<para>Replace <option><replaceable>~/kdesrc-build</replaceable></option> with
the directory you would like to install to.
</para>

<para>You can update &kdesrc-build; later by running:</para>
<programlisting>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput><command>cd <option><filename class="directory"><replaceable>~/kdesrc-build</replaceable></filename></option></command></userinput>
<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput><command>git <option>pull</option></command></userinput>
</programlisting>

<tip><para>We recommend adding the &kdesrc-build; installation directory to
your <envar>PATH</envar> environment variable, so that you can run &kdesrc-build;
without having to fully specify its path every time.</para></tip>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="setup-rcfile">
<title>Prepare the configuration file</title>

<para>&kdesrc-build; uses a <link linkend="configure-data">configuration file</link>
to control which modules are built, where they are installed to, etc.
This file is located at <filename>~/.config/kdesrc-buildrc</filename>
(<filename>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/kdesrc-buildrc</filename>, if
<envar>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</envar> is set).</para>

<para>You can use <application>kdesrc-build --generate-config</application> in order to prepare a simple
kdesrc-build configuration. You can then edit the
<filename>~/.config/kdesrc-buildrc</filename> configuration file to make
any changes you see fit.</para>

<sect4 id="setup-rcfile-manually">
<title>Manual setup of configuration file</title>

<para>You can also setup your configuration file manually, by copying the
included sample configuration file <filename>kdesrc-buildrc-kf5-sample</filename>
to <filename>~/.config/kdesrc-buildrc</filename> and then editing the file.
<xref linkend="kdesrc-buildrc"/> will be a useful reference for this, especially
its <link linkend="conf-options-table">table of configuration options</link>.
</para>

<para>&kdesrc-build; contains many recommended configuration files to support
&kde; Frameworks 5, &plasma; 5, and other &kde; applications. See
<xref linkend="kdesrc-buildrc-including"/> for information on how to use other
configuration files from your own <filename>kdesrc-buildrc</filename>.
</para>

<para>You can find more information about the syntax of the <link

</sect4>
</sect3>
</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="configure-data">
<title>Setting the Configuration Data</title>

<para>
To use &kdesrc-build;, you should have a file in your <filename>~/.config</filename>
(or in <envar>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</envar>, if set) directory called
<filename>kdesrc-buildrc</filename>, which sets the general options and
specifies the modules you would like to download and build.
</para>

<note><para>
It is possible to use different configuration files for &kdesrc-build;, which is
described in <xref linkend="kdesrc-buildrc" />. If you need to use multiple
configurations, please see that section. Here, we will assume that the
configuration is stored in <filename>~/.config/kdesrc-buildrc</filename>.
</para></note>

<para>
The easiest way to proceed is to use the
<filename>kdesrc-buildrc-kf5-sample</filename> file as a template, changing global
options to match your wants, and also change the list of modules you want to
build.
</para>

<para>
The default settings should be appropriate to perform a
&kde; build. Some settings that you may wish to alter include:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><link linkend="conf-install-dir">install-dir</link>, which changes the
destination directory that your &kde; software is installed to. This defaults to
<filename class="directory">~/kde/usr</filename>, which is a single-user
installation.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><link linkend="conf-branch-group">branch-group</link>, which can
be
used to choose the appropriate branch of development for the &kde; modules as a
whole. There are many supported build configurations but you will likely want to
choose <option>kf5-qt5</option> so that &kdesrc-build; downloads the latest code
based on &Qt; 5 and &kde; Frameworks 5.</para>

<tip><para>&kdesrc-build; will use a default branch group if you do not choose
one, but this default will change over time, so it's better to choose one so
that the branch group does not change unexpectedly.</para></tip>
</listitem>

<listitem><para><link linkend="conf-source-dir">source-dir</link>, to control the directory
&kdesrc-build; uses for downloading the source code, running the build process, and saving
logs.
This defaults to <filename class="directory">~/kde/src</filename>.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><link linkend="conf-cmake-options">cmake-options</link>, which
sets the options to pass to the &cmake; command when building each module.
Typically this is used to set between <quote>debug</quote> or
<quote>release</quote> builds, to enable (or disable) optional features, or to
pass information to the build process about the location of required libraries.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><link linkend="conf-make-options">make-options</link>, which
sets the options used when actually running the <application>make</application>
command to build each module (once &cmake; has established the build system).
</para>

<para>The most typical option is <option>-j<replaceable>N</replaceable></option>,
where <replaceable>N</replaceable> should be replaced with the maximum number of
compile jobs you wish to allow.  A higher number (up to the number of logical CPUs
your system has available) leads to quicker builds, but requires more system resources.
</para>

<tip><para>&kdesrc-build; sets the option <option><link linkend="conf-num-cores">num-cores</link></option> to
the detected number of available processing cores. You can use this value
in your own configuration file to avoid having to set it manually.
</para></tip>

<example id="make-options-example">

</example>

<note><para>Some very large Git repositories may swamp your system if you try to
compile with a too many build jobs at one time, especially repositories like the
&Qt; WebKit and &Qt; WebEngine repositories.  To maintain system interactivity
you may have to reduce the number of build jobs for specific modules.</para>

<title>Module Sets</title>

<para>The &kde; source code is decomposed into a great number of relatively
small Git-based repositories. To make it easier to manage the large number of
repositories involved in any useful &kde;-based install, &kdesrc-build; supports
grouping multiple modules and treating the group as a <quote>module set</quote>.
</para>

<sect3 id="module-set-concept">
<title>The basic module set concept</title>

<para>By using a module set, you can quickly declare many Git modules to be
downloaded and built, as if you'd typed out a separate module declaration for
each one. The <link linkend="conf-repository">repository</link> option is
handled specially to setup where each module is downloaded from, and every
other option contained in the module set is copied to every module generated
in this fashion.</para>

<para>In <xref linkend="example-using-module-sets"/> a brief module set is

every module given in <option>use-modules</option>, that an individual module
has been declared, with its <option>repository</option> equal to the
module-set's <option>repository</option> followed immediately by the given
module name.</para>

<para>In addition, other options can be passed in a module set, which are
copied to every new module that is created this way. By using module-set it is
possible to quickly declare many Git modules that are all based on the same
repository URL. In addition, it is possible to give module-sets a name (as shown
in the example), which allows you to quickly refer to the entire group of
modules from the command line.</para>

<sect3 id="module-sets-kde">
<title>Special Support for KDE module sets</title>

<para>The module set support described so far is general to any Git-based
modules. For the &kde; Git repositories, &kdesrc-build; includes additional

enabled by specifying <literal>kde-projects</literal> as the

<para>&kdesrc-build; normally only builds the modules you have listed in your

<title>The official &kde; module database</title>

<para>&kde;'s Git repositories allow for grouping related Git modules into
collections of related modules (e.g. kdegraphics). Git doesn't recognize these
groupings, but &kdesrc-build; can understand these groups, using <link

option set to <quote><literal>kde-projects</literal></quote>.</para>

appropriately.  Among other things, &kdesrc-build; will:</para>

<note><para>In the current database, some module groups not only have a

&git; repository. In these situations &kdesrc-build; will currently prefer the

<para>The following example shows how to use the &kde; module database to
install the Phonon multimedia library.</para>

<para>There are two important abilities demonstrated here:</para>

<listitem><para>&kdesrc-build; allows you to specify modules that are
descendents of a given module, without building the parent module, by using the
syntax <userinput><replaceable>module-name</replaceable>/*</userinput>. It is
actually required in this case since the base module, kdegraphics, is marked as
inactive so that it is not accidentally built along with its children modules.
Specifying the descendent modules allows &kdesrc-build; to skip around the
disabled module.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>&kdesrc-build; will also not add a given module to the build
list more than once. This allows us to manually set
<literal>kdegraphics/libs</literal> to build first, before the rest of
<literal>kdegraphics</literal>, without trying to build
<literal>kdegraphics/libs</literal> twice.  This used to be required for proper
dependency handling, and today remains a fallback option in case the &kde;

<sect1 id="kdesrc-build-logging">
<title>&kdesrc-build;'s build logging</title>

<sect2 id="logging-overview">
<title>Logging overview</title>

<para>Logging is a &kdesrc-build; feature whereby the output from every command
that &kdesrc-build; runs is saved to a file for examination later, if
necessary. This is done because it is often necessary to have the output of
these programs when there is a build failure, because there are so many
reasons why a build can fail in the first place.</para>

<sect3 id="log-directory-layout">
<title>Logging directory layout</title>

<para>The logs are always stored under the log directory. The destination of
the log directory is controlled by the <link linkend="conf-log-dir">log-dir</link>
option, which defaults to <filename class="directory"><symbol>${source-dir}</symbol>/log</filename> (where
<symbol>${source-dir}</symbol> is the value of the <link linkend="conf-source-dir">source-dir</link>
option. The in rest of this section, this value will be referred to as
<symbol>${log-dir}</symbol>).</para>

<para>Under <symbol>${log-dir}</symbol>, is a set of directories, one for every
time that &kdesrc-build; was run. Each directory is named with the date, and
the run number. For instance, the second time that &kdesrc-build; is run on
May 26, 2004, it would create a directory called <filename>2004-05-26-02</filename>,
where the 2004-05-26 is for the date, and the -02 is the run number.</para>

<para>For your convenience, &kdesrc-build; will also create a link to the
logs for your latest run, called <filename class="directory">latest</filename>. So the logs for
the most recent &kdesrc-build; run should always be under <filename class="directory"><symbol>${log-dir}</symbol>/latest</filename>.
</para>

<para>Now, each directory for a &kdesrc-build; run will itself contain a set of
directories, one for every &kde; module that &kdesrc-build; tries to build. Also,
a file called <filename>build-status</filename> will be contained in the directory,
which will allow you to determine which modules built and which failed.</para>

<note><para>
If a module itself has a submodule (such as extragear/multimedia,
playground/utils, or KDE/kdelibs), then there would actually be a matching
layout in the log directory. For example, the logs for KDE/kdelibs after the
last &kdesrc-build; run would be found in <filename class="directory"><symbol>${log-dir}</symbol>/latest/KDE/kdelibs</filename>,
and not under <filename class="directory"><symbol>${log-dir}</symbol>/latest/kdelibs</filename>.
</para></note>

<para>In each module log directory, you will find a set of files for each
operation that &kdesrc-build; performs. If &kdesrc-build; updates a module,
you may see filenames such as <filename>git-checkout-update.log</filename> (for a
module checkout or when updating a module
that has already been checked out). If the <command>configure</command>
command was run, then you would expect to see a <filename>configure.log</filename>

<para>If an error occurred, you should be able to see an explanation of why in
one of the files. To help you determine which file contains the error,
&kdesrc-build; will create a link from the file containing the error (such as
<filename>build-1.log</filename> to a file called <filename>error.log</filename>).</para>

<para>The upshot to all of this is that to see why a module failed to build
after your last &kdesrc-build;, the file you should look at first is
<filename><symbol>${log-dir}</symbol>/latest/<replaceable>module-name</replaceable>/error.log</filename>.
</para>

<tip><para>If the file <filename>error.log</filename> is empty (especially after
an installation), then perhaps there was no error. Some of the tools used by
the &kde; build system will sometimes mistakenly report an error when there was
none.</para>

<para>Also, some commands will evade &kdesrc-build;'s output redirection and
bypass the log file in certain circumstances (normally when performing the
first &git; checkout), and the error output in that case is not in the log file
but is instead at the &konsole; or terminal where you ran &kdesrc-build;.</para>

<title>Overview of &kdesrc-build; configuration</title>

<para>
To use the script, you must have a file in your home directory called
<filename>.kdesrc-buildrc</filename>, which describes the modules you would
like to download and build, and any options or configuration parameters to
use for these modules.
</para>

<sect2 id="kdesrc-buildrc-layout">
<title>Layout of the configuration file</title>

<sect3 id="kdesrc-buildrc-layout-global">
<title>Global configuration</title>

<para>
The configuration file starts with the global options, specified like the
following:
</para>

<programlisting>
global
<replaceable>option-name option-value</replaceable>
<replaceable>[...]</replaceable>
end global
</programlisting>

</sect3>
<sect3 id="kdesrc-buildrc-layout-modules">
<title>Module configuration</title>

<para>
It is then followed by one or more module sections, specified in one of the
following two forms:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<programlisting>
module <replaceable>module-name</replaceable>
<replaceable>option-name option-value</replaceable>
<replaceable>[...]</replaceable>
end module
</programlisting>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<programlisting>

# Other options may also be set
<replaceable>option-name option-value</replaceable>
<replaceable>[...]</replaceable>
end module-set
</programlisting>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<important><para>Note that the second form, module sets, <emphasis>only works
for Git-based modules</emphasis>.</para></important>

<para>
For Git modules, <replaceable>module-name</replaceable> must be a module
from the &kde; &git; repository (for example, kdeartwork or
kde-wallpapers).
</para>

<para>
For Git modules, the module name can be essentially whatever you'd like, as
long as it does not duplicate any other module name in the configuration. Keep
in mind the source and build directory layout will be based on the module name
if you do not use the <link linkend="conf-dest-dir">dest-dir</link> option.
</para>

<para>However, for Git <emphasis>module sets</emphasis> the
<replaceable>module-names</replaceable> must correspond with actual git modules
in the chosen <option>repository</option>. See <link
linkend="conf-git-repository-base">git-repository-base</link> or <link
linkend="conf-use-modules">use-modules</link> for more information.
</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 id="kdesrc-buildrc-option-values">
<title>Processing of option values</title>

<para>In general, the entire line contents after the
<replaceable>option-name</replaceable> is used as the
<replaceable>option-value</replaceable>.</para>

<para>One modification that &kdesrc-build; performs is that a sequence
<userinput>${<replaceable>name-of-option</replaceable>}</userinput> is replaced
with the value of that option from the global configuration. This allows you
to reference the value of existing options, including options already set by
&kdesrc-build;.</para>

<para>
To see an example of this in use, see
<xref linkend="make-options-example"/>.</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 id="kdesrc-buildrc-options-groups">
<title><quote>options</quote> modules</title>

<para>There is a final type of configuration file entry,
<literal>options</literal> groups, which may be given wherever a
<literal>module</literal> or <literal>module-set</literal> may be used.</para>

<programlisting>
options <replaceable>module-name</replaceable>
<replaceable>option-name option-value</replaceable>
<replaceable>[...]</replaceable>
end options
</programlisting>

<para>An <literal>options</literal> group may have options set for it just like
a module declaration, and is associated with an existing module. Any options
set these way will be used to <emphasis>override</emphasis> options set for the
associated module.</para>

<important><para>The associated module name <emphasis>must</emphasis> match the
name given in the <literal>options</literal> declaration. Be careful of
mis-typing the name.</para></important>

<para>This is useful to allow for declaring an entire
<literal>module-set</literal> worth of modules, all using the same options, and
then using <literal>options</literal> groups to make individual changes.</para>

<para><literal>options</literal> groups can also apply to named module sets.
This allows expert users to use a common configuration file (which includes
<literal>module-set</literal> declarations) as a baseline, and then make changes
to the options used by those module-sets in configuration files that
use the <literal><link
linkend="kdesrc-buildrc-including">include</link></literal> command to reference
the base configuration.</para>

<example id="ex-options-group">
<title>Example of using options</title>

<para>In this example we choose to build all modules from the &kde; multimedia
software grouping. However we want to use a different version of the &kmix;
application (perhaps for testing a bug fix). It works as follows:</para>

<programlisting>
module-set <replaceable>kde-multimedia-set</replaceable>
  repository <userinput>kde-projects</userinput>
  use-modules <replaceable>kde/kdemultimedia</replaceable>
  branch <replaceable>master</replaceable>
end module-set

# kmix is a part of kde/kdemultimedia group, even though we never named
# kmix earlier in this file, &kdesrc-build; will figure out the change.
options <replaceable>kmix</replaceable>
  branch <replaceable>KDE/4.12</replaceable>
end options
</programlisting>

<para>Now when you run &kdesrc-build;, all of the &kde; multimedia programs will
be built from the <quote>master</quote> branch of the source repository, but
&kmix; will be built from the older <quote>KDE/4.12</quote> branch. By using
<literal>options</literal> you didn't have to individually list all the
<emphasis>other</emphasis> &kde; multimedia programs to give them the right
branch option.</para>

</example>

<note>
<para>Note that this feature is only available in &kdesrc-build; from version
1.16, or using the development version of &kdesrc-build; after
2014-01-12.</para></note>

</sect3>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="kdesrc-buildrc-including">
<title>Including other configuration files</title>

<para>
Within the configuration file, you may reference other files by using the
<literal>include</literal> keyword with a file, which will act as if the file
referenced had been inserted into the configuration file at that point.
</para>

<informalexample><para>For example, you could have something like this:</para>
<programlisting>
global
    include <replaceable>~/common-kdesrc-build-options</replaceable>

    # Insert specific options here.

end global
</programlisting>
</informalexample>

<note><para>If you don't specify the full path to the file to include, then
the file will be searched for starting from the directory containing the source
file. This works recursively as well.</para></note>

<para>This option is used to configure the layout which &kdesrc-build; should use when
creating source and build directories.</para>
<para>The <userinput>flat</userinput> layout is the default value, and will group all modules
directly underneath the top level source and build directories. For example,
<literal>source/extragear/network/telepathy/ktp-text-ui</literal> in the <userinput>metadata</userinput>
layout would be <literal>source/ktp-text-ui</literal> using the <userinput>flat</userinput> layout
instead.
</para>
<para>The <userinput>invent</userinput> layout creates a directory hierarchy mirroring the relative
paths of repositories on <ulink url="https://invent.kde.org/">invent.kde.org</ulink>. For example
<literal>source/kde/applications/kate</literal> in the <userinput>metadata</userinput> layout would
be <literal>source/utilities/kate</literal> using the <userinput>invent</userinput> layout instead.
This layout only affects KDE projects. It is a good choice for people starting out with
&kdesrc-build;.
</para>
<para>Finally, the <userinput>metadata</userinput> layout is the same as the old default
behaviour. This layout organises KDE projects according to the project paths specified in the
project metadata for these modules. This is a good choice if you want a directory layout which
tracks with certain KDE processes, but note that this path is therefore not always stable. As a
result, &kdesrc-build; may abandon an old copy of the repository and clone a new one for a project
due to changes in the project metadata.</para>

<para>You must specify two things (separated by a space): The name to assign

module module2

<para>The option value does not necessarily have to name the module directly.

<para>The order that modules are defined in this option is important, because
that is also the order that &kdesrc-build; will process the generated modules
when updating, building, and installing. All modules defined in the given
module-set will be handled before &kdesrc-build; moves to the next module after

<title>&ssh; Agent checks</title>
<para>&kdesrc-build; can ensure that &kde; developers that use &ssh; to
access the &kde; source repository do not accidentally forget to leave the
&ssh; Agent tool enabled. This can cause &kdesrc-build; to hang indefinitely
waiting for the developer to type in their &ssh; password,
so by default &kdesrc-build; will check if the Agent is running before
performing source updates.
</para>

<para>You may wish to disable the &ssh; Agent check, in case of situations where

<sect2 id="deleting-build-dir">
<title>Removing unneeded directories after a build</title>
<para>Are you short on disk space but still want to run a bleeding-edge
&kde; checkout?  &kdesrc-build; can help reduce your disk usage when building
&kde; from &git;.</para>

<note><para>Be aware that building &kde; does take a lot of space. There are
several major space-using pieces when using &kdesrc-build;:</para></note>

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>The actual source checkout can take up a fair amount of space.
The default modules take up about 1.6 gigabytes of on-disk space. You can reduce
this amount by making sure that you are only building as many modules as you
actually want. &kdesrc-build; will not delete source code from disk even if you
delete the entry from the <link linkend="configure-data">configuration file</link>, so make sure that you go and delete unused
source checkouts from the source directory. Note that the source files are
downloaded from the Internet, you <emphasis>should not</emphasis> delete them
if you are actually using them, at least until you are done using
&kdesrc-build;.</para>

<para>Also, if you already have a &Qt; installed by your distribution (and
the odds are good that you do), you probably do not need to install the
qt module. That will shave about 200 megabytes off of the on-disk source
size.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>&kdesrc-build; will create a separate build directory to build the source
code in. Sometimes &kdesrc-build; will have to copy a source directory to
create a fake build directory. When this happens, space-saving symlinks are
used, so this should not be a hassle on disk space. The build directory will
typically be much larger than the source directory for a module. For example,
the build directory for kdebase is about 1050 megabytes, whereas kdebase's
source is only around 550 megabytes.</para>

<para>Luckily, the build directory is not required after a module has
successfully been built and installed. &kdesrc-build; can automatically
remove the build directory after installing a module, see the examples below
for more information. Note that taking this step will make it impossible
for &kdesrc-build; to perform the time-saving incremental builds.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para>
Finally, there is disk space required for the actual installation of
&kde;, which does not run from the build directory. This typically takes less
space than the build directory. It is harder to get exact figures however.
</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>How do you reduce the space requirements of &kde;?  One way is to
use the proper compiler flags, to optimize for space reduction instead of
for speed. Another way, which can have a large effect, is to remove debugging
information from your &kde; build.
</para>

<warning><para>
You should be very sure you know what you are doing before deciding to remove
debugging information. Running bleeding-edge software means you are running
software which is potentially much more likely to crash than a stable release.
If you are running software without debugging information, it can be very
hard to create a good bug report to get your bug resolved, and you will likely
have to re-enable debugging information for the affected application and
rebuild to help a developer fix the crash. So, remove debugging information
at your own risk!
</para></warning>

<informalexample>
<para>Removing the build directory after installation of a module. The source
directory is still kept, and debugging is enabled:</para>

  configure-flags      --enable-debug

<title>Introduction to &cmake;</title>

<para>In March 2006, the &cmake; program
beat out several competitors and was selected to be the build system for &kde; 4, replacing the
autotools-based system that &kde; had used from the beginning.</para>

<para>A introduction to &cmake; page is available on the <ulink

Basically, instead of running <userinput><command>make</command> <option>-f</option>
<filename>Makefile.cvs</filename></userinput>, then <command>configure</command>,
then &make;, we simply run &cmake; and then &make;.
</para>

<para>&kdesrc-build; has support for &cmake;. A few features of &kdesrc-build;
were really features of the underlying buildsystem, including
<link linkend="conf-configure-flags">configure-flags</link>
and <link linkend="conf-do-not-compile">do-not-compile</link>. When equivalent
features are available, they are provided. For instance, the equivalent to the
configure-flags option is <link linkend="conf-cmake-options">cmake-options</link>, and the
<link linkend="conf-do-not-compile">do-not-compile</link> option is also supported for &cmake;
as of &kdesrc-build; version 1.6.3.
