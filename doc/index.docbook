<!-- Deliberately not KDE SC, we can also install Extragear, amarok, etc. -->
</para>

<tip><para>This software used to be called kdesvn-build, so you may still see
references to kdesvn-build on the Internet or in your installed documentation.</para></tip>

<para>
This guide is an overview to describe the following aspects of &kdesrc-build;
operation:

&kdesrc-build;).
</para>

</chapter>
<chapter id="getting-started">
<title>Getting Started</title>

<para>
In this chapter, we show how to use the &kdesrc-build; to checkout modules from
the &kde; repository and build them. We also provide a basic explanation of the
&kde; &subversion; structure and the steps you have to perform before running
the script.
</para>

<para>
All topics present in this chapter are covered with even more detail in the
<ulink url="http://techbase.kde.org/Getting_Started/Build/KDE4">
Building &kde; 4 from Source</ulink> article, at the
<ulink url="http://techbase.kde.org/">&kde; TechBase site</ulink>.
If you are compiling &kde; for the first time, it is a good idea to read
it, or consult it as a reference source. You will find detailed information
about packaging tools and requirements, common compilation pitfalls and
strategies and information about running your new &kde; installation.
</para>

<sect1 id="before-building">
<title>Preparing the System to Build &kde;</title>

<sect2 id="before-building-users">
<title>Setup a new user account</title>

<para>
It is recommended that you use a different user account to build, install,
and run your &kde; software from, since less permissions are required, and
to avoid interfering with your distribution's packages.
If you already have &kde; packages installed, the best choice
would be to create a different (dedicated) user to build and run the new &kde;.
</para>

<tip><para>Leaving your system &kde; untouched also allows you to have an
emergency fallback in case a compiled &kde; is unstable for whatever reason.
</para></tip>

<para>
Later, you can do a system installation if you wish. This document
does not cover a system installation. If you are performing a system
wide install, you should already know what you are doing. If not, then you
may want to consult the documentation, or help sites, for your distribution
in order to prepare and use the system installation correctly.
</para>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="before-building-preparation">
<title>Ensure your system is ready to build &kde; source</title>

<para>Before using the &kdesrc-build; script (or any other building
strategy) you must install the development tools and libraries needed for &kde;.
The complete list of required tools can be found from
the <ulink url="http://techbase.kde.org/">KDE TechBase</ulink>.
</para>

<para>Here is a list of some of the things you will need:</para>
<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>You will need &cmake;.  The required version will vary
depending on what version of &kde; 4 you are building, see TechBase for
specifics.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Also needed is the &subversion; client program.  You can check
if you have it by running <userinput><command>svn
<option>--version</option></command></userinput>.  </para></listitem>

<listitem><para>You will also need the <ulink url="http://gitscm.org/">Git
source control manager</ulink> installed as well, for &kde;'s <ulink
url="http://projects.kde.org/">git-based projects.</ulink>
.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>You will need a C++ development environment. GCC 4.2 or
later is recommended.</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<note><para>Most operating system distributions include a method of easily
installing required development tools. Consult the TechBase <ulink
url="http://techbase.kde.org/Getting_Started/Build/KDE4">Getting Started</ulink>
page's <quote>Required Packages from your Distribution</quote> section to see
if these instructions are already available.</para></note>

<para>One exception to the required libraries is the &Qt; library.
&kdesrc-build; will normally install a copy of &Qt; whether you have it
installed or not, so it is not necessary for you to have it. If you do not want
to use the &Qt; copy, you need to do these things:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
  <para>Make sure to remove the qt-copy module from your <link
  linkend="configure-data">configuration file</link>, as you will not need it,
  and having it would add extra time to your build.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
  <para>Change the setting of the <link linkend="conf-qtdir">qtdir</link>
  option in your <link linkend="configure-data">configuration file</link> to
  point to your system &Qt;. This is normally equal to the setting of
  $<envar>QTDIR</envar> for your system.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
  <para>If you do not already have &Qt; installed, install it, including any
  relevant -dev or -devel packages. You will need at least
  &Qt; 4.7 if you are building &kde; 4.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
Some of these packages are divided into libraries (or programs or utilities), and
development packages. You will need at least the program or library and
its development package. If in doubt, install all. The libraries you need
will change depending on the modules you intend to build, as each module
has its own requirements. The
<ulink url="http://techbase.kde.org/Getting_Started/Build/KDE4#Required_packages_from_your_distribution">&kde;
TechBase</ulink> has more details
about the specific tools and techniques used to install and find the
required software.

<para>
You probably already have a version of the &kdesrc-build; script installed
in your system. However, if you do not, you can download it from
<ulink url="http://kdesrc-build.kde.org/">&kdesrc-build; home page</ulink>,
or you can find it from its home in the &kde; source repository.</para>

<tip><para>If you use a more recent &kdesrc-build; by downloading from its
website, you should remember to run the &kdesrc-build; script you downloaded.
You can use the <option>--version</option> option to &kdesrc-build; as a quick
way to verify this.</para></tip>

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>To download &kdesrc-build; from its home page, simply go to the
<ulink url="http://kdesrc-build.kde.org/">&kdesrc-build; home page</ulink> and download the latest appropriate release. The release is
packaged as a compressed tarball archive, which you can extract using &ark; or
<command>tar</command>. The contents of the archive include the actual
&kdesrc-build; script, a sample configuration file
(<filename>kdesrc-buildrc-sample</filename>), and a quick-setup
program.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Or, you can obtain &kdesrc-build; from its source repository,
located at: <ulink
url="http://quickgit.kde.org/?p=kdesrc-build.git&amp;a=tree&amp;hb=refs/heads/master">http://quickgit.kde.org/?p=kdesrc-build.git&amp;a=tree&amp;hb=refs/heads/master</ulink>.
You can click on the <filename>kdesrc-build</filename> entry which will bring
you to a page where you can download the latest revision.  Click on the
<quote>plain</quote> link for the file to download it directly, and save it to
a convenient spot on your hard disk. Do the same for
<filename>kdesrc-buildrc-sample</filename> if you need to.</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>No matter which technique you use, you need to make sure that the
<filename>kdesrc-build</filename> file is executable. For convenience you
should make sure it is in a directory contained in the <envar>PATH</envar>
environment variable, otherwise you may get messages saying that the command
was not found, or you may run a previously-installed version by mistake.</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="setup-rcfile">
<title>Prepare the configuration file</title>

<para>&kdesrc-build; uses a <link linkend="configure-data">configuration
file</link> (located at <filename>~/.kdesrc-buildrc</filename>) to control
which modules are built, where they are installed to, etc.</para>

<para>You can use a program included with &kdesrc-build;, called
<application>kdesrc-build-setup</application> in order to prepare a simple
kdesrc-build configuration. You can then edit the
<filename>~/.kdesrc-buildrc</filename> from there to make any changes you see
fit.</para>

<para><application>kdesrc-build-setup</application> itself runs from a terminal
(instead of using a graphical interface), just like &kdesrc-build;, so you can
use it even if you have no graphical interface available yet.</para>

<tip><para>You can use the included <filename>kdesrc-buildrc-sample</filename>
sample configuration to get explanations as to the various options available.
</para></tip>

<para>You can find more information about the syntax of the <link linkend="configure-data">configuration file</link>
in <xref linkend="configure-data" /> and in <xref linkend="kdesrc-buildrc" />.
</para>

</sect3>
</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="configure-data">
<title>Setting the Configuration Data</title>

<para>
To use &kdesrc-build;, you should have a file in your home directory called
<filename>.kdesrc-buildrc</filename>, which sets the general options and sets the modules
you would like to download and build.
</para>

<note><para>It is possible to use different configuration files for &kdesrc-build;,
which is described in <xref linkend="kdesrc-buildrc" />. If you need to use
multiple configurations, please see that section. Here, we will assume the
configuration is stored in <filename>~/.kdesrc-buildrc</filename>.</para></note>

<para>
The easiest way to proceed is to use the
<filename>kdesrc-buildrc-sample</filename> file as a template, changing global
options to match your wants, and also change the list of modules you want to
build.
</para>

<para>
The default settings should actually already be appropriate to perform a
&kde; build. Some settings that you may wish to alter include:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><link linkend="conf-use-stable-kde">use-stable-kde</link> to
change the default version of &kde; modules to build. By default &kdesrc-build;
will build the trunk version of &kde;. If you want to build
the latest stable release of &kde; instead of using your distribution packages
you would set this option to <replaceable>true</replaceable>.
</para>

<tip><para>Note that this option relies on information available from the
&kde; project database, so this feature only works for these modules.
See also <xref linkend="kde-projects-module-sets"/>.
</para></tip>
</listitem>

<listitem><para><link linkend="conf-kdedir">kdedir</link>, which changes the
destination directory that &kde; is installed to. This defaults to
<filename class="directory">~/kde</filename>, which is a single-user installation.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><link linkend="conf-qtdir">qtdir</link>, which controls the
path to the installation of &Qt; to use. The default is to use a &Qt; compiled
by &kdesrc-build;, using the special qt-copy module and the latest available
source code.
(<filename class="directory">~/kdesrc/build/qt-copy</filename>).</para>

<note><para>This also controls where to install qt-copy.</para></note>
</listitem>

<listitem><para><link linkend="conf-svn-server">svn-server</link>, which
selects what &url; to download the sources from. This is useful if you are a
developer with a <ulink url="http://techbase.kde.org/Contribute/First_Steps_with_your_KDE_SVN_Account">&kde;
&subversion; account</ulink>.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>Continue to <xref linkend="kde-modules-and-selection"/> to see how to

<sect1 id="kde-modules-and-selection">
<title>Module Organization and selection</title>

<sect2 id="kde-layers">
<title>KDE Software Organization</title>

<para>
&kde; software is split into different components, many of which can be built
by &kdesrc-build;. Understanding this organization will help you properly
select the software modules that you want built.
</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>At the lowest level comes Nokia's &Qt; library, which is a
very powerful, cross-platform <quote>toolkit</quote> library. &kde; is based on
&Qt;, and some of the non-&kde; libraries required by &kde; are also based on
&Qt;. &kdesrc-build; can build &Qt;, or use the one already installed on your
system if it is a recent enough version.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>On top of &Qt; are required libraries that are necessary for
&kde; software to work. Some of these libraries are not considered part of
&kde; itself due to their generic nature, but are still essential to the &kde;
Platform. These libraries tended to get combined into a single
<literal>kdesupport</literal> module.</para>

<note><para>As of &kde; Platform 4.6, many of these kdesupport modules are being
migrated over to <ulink url="http://projects.kde.org/">git.kde.org</ulink>,
although they are still not considered part of the Platform.</para></note>
</listitem>

<listitem><para>On top of these essential libraries comes the &kde; Platform.
These are the libraries that are required for &kde; applications to work. A
full desktop environment is not provided by the Platform however.
</para>

<para>For &kdesrc-build;, the Platform layer consists of the <literal>kdelibs</literal>,
<literal>kdepimlibs</literal>, and <literal>kde-runtime</literal> modules.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para>On top of the Platform, come several different things:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para><quote>Third-party</quote> applications. These are
        applications that use the &kde; Platform but are not authored by or in
        association with the &kde; project.</para></listitem>

        <listitem><para>A full <quote>workspace</quote> desktop environment.
        This is what users normally see when they <quote>log-in to
        &kde;</quote>.  This is provided by the &plasma; Desktop, mostly in
        <literal>kde-workspace</literal>.  </para></listitem>

        <listitem><para>The &kde; Software Compilation. This is a collection of
        useful software included with the Platform and &plasma; Desktop,
        grouped into individual modules. These are the modules that have names

        <literal>kdepim</literal> is a component of the Software Compilation
        that contains email, news-reading, calendar/organizational software,

</sect2>

<sect2 id="selecting-modules">
<title>Selecting modules to build</title>

<para>Selecting which of the possible modules to build is controlled by
<link linkend="kdesrc-buildrc">the configuration file</link>.
After the <literal>global</literal> section is a list of modules to build,
bracketed by module ... end module lines. An example entry for a module is
shown in <xref linkend="conf-module-example"/>.</para>

<example id="conf-module-example">
<title>Example module entry in the configuration file</title>
<programlisting>
module <replaceable>module-name</replaceable>
    # Options for this module go here, example:
    <link linkend="conf-make-options">make-options</link> -j4 # Run 4 compiles at a time
end module
</programlisting>
</example>

<tip><para>It is possible to declare a module with no options. In fact, most of
your modules will likely be declared this way.</para></tip>

<para>&kdesrc-build; only builds the modules you have listed in your configuration
file. In addition, the modules are built in the order specified in the configuration
file. For this reason you should ensure that the order of modules in your
configuration file is consistent with the organization given in
<xref linkend="kde-layers"/>.</para>

<para>There is a sample file that comes with &kdesrc-build; called
<filename>kdesrc-buildrc-sample</filename>. It is recommended to copy this file
to a file called <filename>~/.kdesrc-buildrc</filename> (<emphasis>Note the
leading period in front of kdesrc-buildrc!</emphasis>). Afterwards, edit the
new file to adjust the default options to your liking. (Each option is described
in more detail in <xref linkend="kdesrc-buildrc"/>). The default modules
should be enough to ensure a fairly complete &kde; installation, however you
can remove many of the modules that show up after <literal>kdebase</literal>
if you'd like to save disk space or build time.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="module-sets">
<title>Module Sets</title>

<para>&kdesrc-build; is usually able to guess where to download the source code
for a given module quite easily, by using your setting for <link
linkend="conf-svn-server">svn-server</link> and the module name for each module
to create a single Subversion URL, which describes exactly where to download
the source code from.</para>

<para>With the move to Git, many larger Subversion modules were further
sub-divided in the process, and there was no guarantee of where to find a
module based just on the module name. Because of this, a concept called
<quote>module sets</quote> was developed for &kdesrc-build; 1.12.1.</para>

<para>By using a module set, you can quickly declare many Git modules to be
downloaded and built, as if you'd typed out a separate module declaration for
each one. The <link linkend="conf-repository">repository</link> option is
handled specially to setup where each module is downloaded from, which every
other option contained in the module set is copied to every module generated
in this fashion.</para>

<example id="example-using-module-sets">
<title>Using module sets</title>
<programlisting>
global
    <option><link linkend="conf-git-repository-base">git-repository-base</link></option> <replaceable>kde-git</replaceable> <replaceable>kde:</replaceable>
end global

module <replaceable>qt-copy</replaceable>
    # Options removed for brevity
end module

module-set <replaceable>kde-support-libs</replaceable>
    <option><link linkend="conf-repository">repository</link></option> <replaceable>kde-git</replaceable>
    <option><link linkend="conf-use-modules">use-modules</link></option> <replaceable>automoc</replaceable> <replaceable>attica</replaceable> <replaceable>akonadi</replaceable>
end module-set

# Other modules as necessary...
module <replaceable>kdesupport</replaceable>
end module
</programlisting>
</example>

<para>In <xref linkend="example-using-module-sets"/> a brief module set is
shown.  When &kdesrc-build; encounters this module set, it acts as if, for
every module given in <option>use-modules</option>, that an individual module
has been declared, with its <option>repository</option> equal to the
module-set's <option>repository</option> followed immediately by the given
module name.</para>

<para>In addition, other options can be passed in a module set, which are
copied to every new module that is created this way. By using module-set it is
possible to quickly declare many Git modules that are all based on the same
repository URL. In addition, since &kdesrc-build; 1.13, it is possible to
give module-sets a name (as shown in the example), which allows you to quickly
refer to the entire group of modules from the command line.</para>

<note><para>Module sets are used in supporting module downloads from
the &kde; <ulink url="https://projects.kde.org/">projects.kde.org</ulink>
module database. See also <xref linkend="kde-projects-module-sets"/>.

<sect2 id="kde-projects-module-sets">
<title>Automatically finding modules from the official &kde; module
database</title>

<para>With the migration of &kde; source code to be hosted on git.kde.org,
there has been an explosive growth in the number of modules (for instance,
a single Subversion module called <literal>kdegraphics</literal> becomes
16 different Git modules).</para>

<para>This was done mostly because each Git module contains the entire project
history (this is actually less wasteful of disk space than it sounds for the
vast majority of &kde; repositories as &git; is highly efficient at storing
repositories).</para>

<para>&kde; allows for grouping Git repositories into collections
of related modules (e.g. kdegraphics). These modules can themselves be grouped
(e.g. &kde; Software Compilation). Git doesn't recognize these groupings, but
&kdesrc-build; can be configured to handle these groups.</para>

<para>The way this is done is by using <link linkend="module-sets">module
sets</link>. Instead of using a specific <literal>git://</literal> repository,
or a repository name created by <link
linkend="conf-git-repository-base">git-repository-base</link>, a special
repository name, <quote><literal>kde-projects</literal></quote> is used.</para>

<para>&kdesrc-build; will recognize that the <literal>kde-projects</literal>
repository requires special handling, and adjust the build process
appropriately.  Among other things, &kdesrc-build; will:</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>Download the latest module database from <ulink
url="https://projects.kde.org/">projects.kde.org</ulink>.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Try to find a module with the name given in the module set's
<option>use-modules</option> setting.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>For every module that is found, &kdesrc-build; will see if a
repository setting exists for that module in the database. If there is a
repository, &kdesrc-build; will automatically use that to download or update
the source code. If there is no repository, &kdesrc-build; treats that module
like a group, and tries to include all &git; source repositories that it finds
in that group.</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<note><para>In the current database, some module groups not only have a
collection of modules, but they <emphasis>also</emphasis> declare their own
&git; repository. In these situations &kdesrc-build; will currently prefer the
group's &git; repository instead of including the childrens' repositories.
</para></note>

<para>The following example shows how to use the &kde; module database to
install the Phonon multimedia library.</para>

<informalexample>
<programlisting>
module-set <replaceable>media-support</replaceable>
    # This option must be kde-projects to use the module database.
    <option><link linkend="conf-repository">repository</link></option> <literal>kde-projects</literal>

    # This option chooses what modules to look for in the database.
    <option><link linkend="conf-use-modules">use-modules</link></option> <replaceable>phonon/phonon</replaceable> <replaceable>phonon-gstreamer</replaceable> <replaceable>phonon-vlc</replaceable>
end module-set
</programlisting>
</informalexample>

<tip><para><literal>phonon/phonon</literal> is used since (with the current
project database) &kdesrc-build; would otherwise have to decide between the
group of projects called <quote>phonon</quote> or the individual project named
<quote>phonon</quote>. Currently &kdesrc-build; would pick the former, which
would build many more backends than needed.</para></tip>

<para>The following example is perhaps more realistic, and shows a feature only
available with the &kde; module database: Building all of the &kde; graphics
applications with only a single declaration.</para>

<informalexample>
<programlisting>
module-set <replaceable>kdegraphics</replaceable>
    # This option must be kde-projects to use the module database.
    <option><link linkend="conf-repository">repository</link></option> <literal>kde-projects</literal>

    # This option chooses what modules to look for in the database.
    <option><link linkend="conf-use-modules">use-modules</link></option> <literal>kdegraphics/libs</literal> <literal>kdegraphics/*</literal>
end module-set
</programlisting>
</informalexample>

<para>There are two important abilities demonstrated here:</para>

<orderedlist>

<listitem><para>&kdesrc-build; allows you to specify modules that are
descendents of a given module, without building the parent module, by using the
syntax <userinput><replaceable>module-name</replaceable>/*</userinput>. It is
actually required in this case since the base module, kdegraphics, is marked as
inactive so that it is not accidentally built along with its children modules.
Specifying the descendent modules allows &kdesrc-build; to skip around the
disabled module.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>&kdesrc-build; will also not add a given module to the build
list more than once. This allows us to manually set
<literal>kdegraphics/libs</literal> to build first, before the rest of
<literal>kdegraphics</literal>, without trying to build
<literal>kdegraphics/libs</literal> twice. This is required at this point
because &kdesrc-build; will not perform dependency handling.

possible that &kdesrc-build; will not succeed the first time you compile &kde;.
Do not despair!
</para>

<para>&kdesrc-build; logs the output of every command it runs. By default,
the log files are kept in <filename class="directory">~/kdesrc/log</filename>. To see what
the caused an error for a module in the last &kdesrc-build; command, usually
it is sufficient to look at <filename class="directory">~/kdesrc/log/latest/<replaceable>module-name</replaceable>/error.log</filename>.</para>

<tip><para>Perhaps the easiest way to find out what error caused a module to
fail to build is to search backward with a case-insensitive search, starting
from the end of the file looking for the word <literal>error</literal>.  Once
that is found, scroll up to make sure there are no other error messages nearby.
The first error message in a group is usually the underlying
problem.</para></tip>

<para>In that file, you will see the error that caused the build to fail for
that module. If the file says (at the bottom) that you are missing some
packages, try installing the package (including any appropriate -dev packages)
before trying to build that module again. Make sure that when you run
&kdesrc-build; again to pass the <link
linkend="cmdline-reconfigure">--reconfigure</link> option so that
&kdesrc-build; forces the module to check for the missing packages
again.</para>

<para>Or, if the error appears to be a build error (such as a syntax error,
<quote>incorrect prototype</quote>, <quote>unknown type</quote>, or similar)
then it is probably an error with the &kde; source, which will hopefully be
resolved within a few days. If it is not resolved within that time, feel free
to mail the <email>kde-devel@kde.org</email> mailing list (subscription may be
required first) in order to report the build failure.</para>

<sect1 id="kdesrc-build-logging">
<title>&kdesrc-build;'s build logging</title>

<sect2 id="logging-overview">
<title>Logging overview</title>

<para>Logging is a &kdesrc-build; feature whereby the output from every command
that &kdesrc-build; runs is saved to a file for examination later, if
necessary. This is done because it is often necessary to have the output of
these programs when there is a build failure, because there are so many
reasons why a build can fail in the first place.</para>

<sect3 id="log-directory-layout">
<title>Logging directory layout</title>

<para>The logs are always stored under the log directory. The destination of
the log directory is controlled by the <link linkend="conf-log-dir">log-dir</link>
option, which defaults to <filename class="directory"><symbol>${source-dir}</symbol>/log</filename> (where
<symbol>${source-dir}</symbol> is the value of the <link linkend="conf-source-dir">source-dir</link>
option. The in rest of this section, this value will be referred to as
<symbol>${log-dir}</symbol>).</para>

<para>Under <symbol>${log-dir}</symbol>, is a set of directories, one for every
time that &kdesrc-build; was run. Each directory is named with the date, and
the run number. For instance, the second time that &kdesrc-build; is run on
May 26, 2004, it would create a directory called <filename>2004-05-26-02</filename>,
where the 2004-05-26 is for the date, and the -02 is the run number.</para>

<para>For your convenience, &kdesrc-build; will also create a link to the
logs for your latest run, called <filename class="directory">latest</filename>. So the logs for
the most recent &kdesrc-build; run should always be under <filename class="directory"><symbol>${log-dir}</symbol>/latest</filename>.
</para>

<para>Now, each directory for a &kdesrc-build; run will itself contain a set of
directories, one for every &kde; module that &kdesrc-build; tries to build. Also,
a file called <filename>build-status</filename> will be contained in the directory,
which will allow you to determine which modules built and which failed.</para>

<note><para>
If a module itself has a submodule (such as extragear/multimedia,
playground/utils, or KDE/kdelibs), then there would actually be a matching
layout in the log directory. For example, the logs for KDE/kdelibs after the
last &kdesrc-build; run would be found in <filename class="directory"><symbol>${log-dir}</symbol>/latest/KDE/kdelibs</filename>,
and not under <filename class="directory"><symbol>${log-dir}</symbol>/latest/kdelibs</filename>.
</para></note>

<para>In each module log directory, you will find a set of files for each
operation that &kdesrc-build; performs. If &kdesrc-build; updates a module,
you may see filenames such as <filename>svn-co.log</filename> (for a
module checkout) or <filename>svn-up.log</filename> (when updating a module
that has already been checked out). If the <command>configure</command>
command was run, then you would expect to see a <filename>configure.log</filename>
in that directory.</para>

<para>If an error occurred, you should be able to see an explanation of why in
one of the files. To help you determine which file contains the error,
&kdesrc-build; will create a link from the file containing the error (such as
<filename>build-1.log</filename> to a file called <filename>error.log</filename>).</para>

<para>The upshot to all of this is that to see why a module failed to build
after your last &kdesrc-build;, the file you should look at first is
<filename><symbol>${log-dir}</symbol>/latest/<replaceable>module-name</replaceable>/error.log</filename>.
</para>

<tip><para>If the file <filename>error.log</filename> is empty (especially after
an installation), then perhaps there was no error. Some of the tools used by
the &kde; build system will sometimes mistakenly report an error when there was
none.</para>

<para>Also, some commands will evade &kdesrc-build;'s output redirection and
bypass the log file in certain circumstances (normally when performing the
first &subversion; checkout), and the error output in that case is not in the log file
but is instead at the &konsole; or terminal where you ran &kdesrc-build;.</para>

It is then followed by one or more module sections, specified in one of the
following two forms:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<programlisting>
module <replaceable>module-name</replaceable>
<replaceable>option-name option-value</replaceable>

end module-set
</programlisting>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<important><para>Note that the second form, module sets, <emphasis>only works
for Git-based modules</emphasis>.</para></important>

<para>
For Subversion modules, <replaceable>module-name</replaceable> must be a module
from the &kde; &subversion; repository (for example, kdeartwork or
kde-wallpapers), although it is possible to get around this if you manually
specify the &subversion; URL.
</para>

<para>
For Git modules, the module name can be essentially whatever you'd like, as
long as it does not duplicate any other module name in the configuration. Keep
in mind the source and build directory layout will be based on the module name
if you do not use the <link linkend="conf-dest-dir">dest-dir</link> option.
</para>

<para>However, for Git <emphasis>module sets</emphasis> the
<replaceable>module-names</replaceable> must correspond with actual git modules
in the chosen <option>repository</option>. See <link
linkend="conf-git-repository-base">git-repository-base</link> or <link
linkend="conf-use-modules">use-modules</link> for more information.

<sect2 id="kdesrc-buildrc-including">

<para>
Within the configuration file, you may reference other files by using the
<literal>include</literal> keyword with a file, which will act as if the file
referenced had been inserted into the configuration file at that point.
</para>

<informalexample><para>For example, you could have something like this:</para>

<entry>apidox</entry>
<entry></entry>
<entry><para>This option was used to allow for building KDE module API documentation.
It was removed in &kdesrc-build; 1.6.3 due to it not being supported in KDE 4.  Online
API documentation is available from <ulink url="http://api.kde.org/">kde.org</ulink>.
In addition it is possible to build KDE 4's API documentation using a script included in
the kdesdk module (/scripts directory).  See <ulink url="http://techbase.kde.org/Development/Tools/apidox">KDE
TechBase</ulink> for more details.  It is still possible to manually build API documentation
for older modules of course.</para>

<entry>This option was removed in kdesrc-build 1.10. To get the same effect,
see <xref linkend="using-qt-copy" /> and the <link
linkend="conf-repository">repository</link> option.</entry>
</row>

<row id="conf-async">
<entry>async</entry>
<entry>Cannot be overridden</entry>
<entry><para>This option enables the asynchronous mode of operation, where the source
code update and the build process will be performed in parallel, instead of waiting for
all of the source code updates before starting the build process.  This option defaults
to enabling asynchronous mode.  To disable, set this option to <userinput>false</userinput></para>
<para>This option is available since the 1.6 release.</para></entry>
</row>

<row id="conf-binpath">
<entry>binpath</entry>
<entry>Module setting overrides global</entry>
<entry><para>Set this option to set the environment variable PATH while building.
You cannot override this setting in a module option. The default value is
the $<envar>PATH</envar> that is set when the script starts. This environment
variable should include the colon-separated paths of your development
toolchain. The paths <filename class="directory">$<envar>KDEDIR</envar>/bin</filename> and
<filename class="directory">$<envar>QTDIR</envar>/bin</filename> are automatically added. You
may use the tilde (~) for any paths you add using this option.</para>
</entry>
</row>

<row id="conf-branch">
<entry>branch</entry>
<entry>Module setting overrides global</entry>
<entry><para>Set this option to checkout from a branch of &kde; instead of the
default of <replaceable>trunk</replaceable>, where &kde; development occurs.
For instance, to checkout &kde; 4.6 branch, you would set this option to
<replaceable>4.6</replaceable>.</para>
<para>If &kdesrc-build; fails to properly download a branch with this option, you
may have to manually specify the &url; to download from using the <link
linkend="conf-module-base-path">module-base-path</link> or <link
linkend="conf-override-url">override-url</link> options.</para>
<para>Note: This option also works with source modules that use
&git; instead of &subversion;.</para>
</entry>
</row>

<row id="conf-build-dir">
<entry>build-dir</entry>
<entry>Module setting overrides global</entry>
<entry>Use this option to change the directory to contain the built sources. There
are three different ways to use it:

<orderedlist>

<listitem><para>Relative to the &kde; &subversion; source directory (see <link
linkend="conf-source-dir">the source-dir option</link>). This is the default,
and is selected if you type a directory name that does not start with a tilde
(~) or a slash (/).</para> <para>The default value is <filename
class="directory">build</filename>.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Absolute path. If you specify a path that begins with a /, then
that path is used directly. For example, <filename
class="directory">/tmp/kde-obj-dir/</filename>.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Relative to your home directory. If you specify a path that
begins with a ~, then the path is used relative to your home directory,
analogous to the shell's tilde-expansion. For example, <filename
class="directory">~/builddir</filename> would set the build directory to
<filename
class="directory">/home/user-name/builddir</filename>.</para></listitem>

</orderedlist>

Perhaps surprisingly, this option can be changed per module.

</entry>
</row>

<row id="conf-build-when-unchanged">
<entry>build-when-unchanged</entry>
<entry>Module setting overrides global</entry>
<entry><para>Use this option in order to control whether &kdesrc-build; always
tries to build a module that has not had any source code updates.</para>

<para>By setting <option>build-when-unchanged</option> to
<userinput>true</userinput>, &kdesrc-build; always attempts the build phase
for a module, even if the module did not have any source code updates. This is
the default setting since it is more likely to lead to a correct
build.</para>

<para>By setting <option>build-when-unchanged</option> to
<userinput>false</userinput>, &kdesrc-build; will only attempt to run the
build phase for a module if the module has a source code update, or in other
situations where it is likely that a rebuild is actually required. This can save
time, especially if you run &kdesrc-build; daily, or more frequently.</para>

<important><para>This feature is provided as an optimization only. Like many
other optimizations, there are trade-offs for the correctness of your
installation. For instance, changes to the qt-copy or kdelibs modules may cause
a rebuild of other modules to be necessary, even if the source code doesn't
change at all.</para></important>
</entry>
</row>

<row id="conf-checkout-only">
<entry>checkout-only</entry>
<entry>Module setting overrides global</entry>
<entry><para>Set this option to checkout &subversion; sources piece by piece. The
value for this option should be a space-separated list of directories to
checkout.  Although this option overrides the global option, be aware that
setting this as a global option makes no sense.
</para>

<para>Note that this setting has no effect on &git; modules due to the
operation of the &git; source control system.</para>

<para>See <xref linkend="checking-out-parts"/> for an example.</para></entry>
</row>

<row id="conf-cmake-options">
<entry>cmake-options</entry>
<entry>Appends to global options (not applicable to qt-copy)</entry>
<entry><para>Use this option to specify what flags to pass to &cmake; when
creating the build system for the module. When this is used as a global option,
it is applied to all modules that this script builds. When used as a module
option, it is added to the end of the global options. This allows you to
specify common &cmake; options in the global section.</para>

<para>This option does not apply to qt-copy (which does not use &cmake;). Use
<link linkend="conf-configure-flags">configure-flags</link> instead.</para>

<para>Since these options are passed directly to the &cmake; command line, they
should be given as they would be typed into &cmake;. For example:</para>

<screen>  cmake-options -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
</screen>

<para>Since this is a hassle, &kdesrc-build; takes pains to ensure that as long
as the rest of the options are set correctly, you should be able to leave this
option blank. (In other words, <emphasis>required</emphasis> &cmake; parameters
are set for you automatically)</para></entry>

<row id="conf-colorful-output">
<entry>colorful-output</entry>
<entry>Cannot be overridden</entry>

This option defaults to <replaceable>true</replaceable>. Note that &kdesrc-build; will not output the
color codes to anything but a terminal (such as xterm, &konsole;, or the normal
&Linux; console).

<row id="conf-cxxflags">
<entry>cxxflags</entry>
<entry>Appends to global option</entry>
<entry><para>Use this option to specify what flags to use for building the
module. This option is
specified here instead of with <link
linkend="conf-configure-flags">configure-flags</link> or <link
linkend="conf-cmake-options">cmake-options</link> because this option will also
set the environment variable <envar>CXXFLAGS</envar> during the build process.</para>

<para>Note that for &kde; 4 and any other modules that use &cmake;, it is necessary to set the
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE option to "none" when configuring the module.  This can be done using the
<link linkend="conf-cmake-options">cmake-options</link> option.</para>

<row id="conf-dest-dir">
<entry>dest-dir</entry>
<entry>Module setting overrides global</entry>
<entry>Use this option to change the name a module is given on disk. For
example, if your module was extragear/network, you could rename it to
extragear-network using this option.  Note that although this changes the
name of the module on disk, it is not a good idea to include directories
or directory separators in the name as this will interfere with any
<link linkend="conf-build-dir">build-dir</link> or
<link linkend="conf-source-dir">source-dir</link> options.
</entry>
</row>

<row id="conf-disable-agent-check">
<entry>disable-agent-check</entry>
<entry>Cannot be overridden</entry>
<entry>Normally if you are using &ssh; to download the &subversion; sources
(such as if you are using the svn+ssh protocol), &kdesrc-build; will try and
make sure that if you are using ssh-agent, it is actually managing some &ssh;
identities. This is to try and prevent &ssh; from asking for your pass phrase
for every module. You can disable this check by setting
<option>disable-agent-check</option> to <userinput>true</userinput>.
</entry>

<row id="conf-do-not-compile">
<entry>do-not-compile</entry>
<entry>Module setting overrides global</entry>
<entry><para>Use this option to select a specific set of directories not to be built in a
module (instead of all of them). The directories not to build should be space-separated.</para>

<para>Note that the sources to the programs will still be downloaded. You can use
the <link linkend="conf-checkout-only">checkout-only</link>
directive to choose directories that you want to check out.</para>

<para>For example, to hold &juk; and &kscd; in the kdemultimedia module from
compiling, you would add "do-not-compile juk kscd" to your kdemultimedia settings.</para>

<row id="conf-git-repository-base">
<entry>git-repository-base</entry>
<entry>Cannot be overridden</entry>
<entry><para>This option, added in version 1.12.1, is used to create a short
name to reference a specific Git repository base URL in later <link
linkend="module-sets">module set</link> declarations, which is useful for
quickly declaring many Git modules to build.</para>

<para>You must specify two things (separated by a space): The name to assign
to the base URL, and the actual base URL itself. For example:</para>

<para>
<informalexample>
<programlisting>
global
   # other options

   # This is the common path to all anonymous Git server modules.
   git-repository-base <replaceable>kde-git</replaceable> <replaceable>kde:</replaceable>

   <link linkend="conf-use-modules">use-modules</link> <replaceable>module1.git</replaceable> <replaceable>module2.git</replaceable>
end module-set
</programlisting>
</informalexample>
</para>

<para>The module-set's <literal>use-modules</literal> option created two modules
internally, with &kdesrc-build; behaving as if it had read:</para>

<programlisting>

end module

module module2
    repository kde:<replaceable>module2.git</replaceable>

<para>The <literal>kde:</literal> &git; repository prefix used above is a
shortcut which will be setup by &kdesrc-build; automatically. See the TechBase
<ulink

Renaming</ulink> article for more information. Note that unlike most other
options, this option can be specified multiple times in order to create as
many aliases as necessary.</para>

this option exists to make it easy to use the same repository across many
different module sets.</para></tip>

<entry>Module setting overrides global</entry>
<entry>This option is used to install the package after it successfully builds.
This option is enabled by default. If you want to disable this, you need to set
this option to <userinput>false</userinput> in the <link

<para>To use this option, set it to a space-separated list of languages to
install. Each language has a language code associated with it, which you
can look up at this page: <ulink
url="http://i18n.kde.org/teams/">http://i18n.kde.org/teams/</ulink>.
</para>

<para>It is alright to choose only one language. By default, none are
downloaded, which means &kde; will display in American English.</para>

<para>For instance, to choose to install French, you would set the option to
something like: <userinput><option>kde-languages</option>
<replaceable>fr</replaceable></userinput>.  You would still need to use
&systemsettings; in order to choose the French language, however.</para>

<para>The order that modules are defined in this option is important, because
that is also the order that &kdesrc-build; will process the generated modules

the module-set.</para>

<para>If you need to change the options for a generated module, simply declare
the module again after it is defined in the module-set, and set your options
as needed. Although you will change the options set for the module this way,
the module will still be updated and built in the order set by the module-set
(i.e. you can't reorder the build sequence doing this).</para>

released.</para>

<para>So, if you set this option to <replaceable>true</replaceable>,
&kdesrc-build; will (for a given module) automatically download the version of

<sect2 id="cmdline-usage-modules">
<title>Specifying modules to build</title>

<para>In general, specifying modules to build is as simple as passing their
module name as you defined it in the configuration file. You can also pass
modules that are part of a module set, either as named on <link
linkend="conf-use-modules">use-modules</link>, or the name of the entire module
set itself, if you have given it a name.</para>

<para>In the specific case of module sets based against the <link
linkend="kde-projects-module-sets">KDE project database</link>, &kdesrc-build;
will expand module name components to determine the exact module you
want. For example, &kdesrc-build;'s KDE project entry locates the project in
<literal>extragear/utils/kdesrc-build</literal>. You could specify any
of the following to build &kdesrc-build;:</para>

<informalexample>
<screen>
<prompt>&percnt;</prompt> <command>kdesrc-build</command> <option><replaceable>+extragear/utils/kdesrc-build</replaceable></option>
<prompt>&percnt;</prompt> <command>kdesrc-build</command> <option><replaceable>+utils/kdesrc-build</replaceable></option>
<prompt>&percnt;</prompt> <command>kdesrc-build</command> <option><replaceable>+kdesrc-build</replaceable></option>
</screen>
</informalexample>

<note><para>The commands in the previous example preceded the module-name with
a <symbol>+</symbol>. This forces the module name to be interpreted as a module
from the KDE project database, even if that module hasn't been defined in your
configuration file.
</para></note>

<para>Be careful about specifying very generic projects (e.g.
<literal>extragear/utils</literal> by itself), as this can lead to a large
amount of modules being built. You should use the <option>--pretend</option>
option before building a new module set to ensure it is only building the
modules you want.</para>

<title>Preface</title>

<para>Normally using &kdesrc-build; after you have gone through <xref linkend="getting-started" />
is as easy as doing the following from a terminal prompt:</para>

<screen>
<prompt>&percnt;</prompt> <command><userinput>kdesrc-build</userinput></command>
</screen>

<para>&kdesrc-build; will then download the sources for &kde;, try to configure

<sect2 id="using-qt-copy">
<title>qt-copy support</title>
<para>&kdesrc-build; supports building the &Qt; toolkit used by &kde; software
as a convenience to users. This support is handled by a special module named
qt-copy.</para>

<note><para>&Qt; is developed under a separate repository from &kde; software
located at <ulink
url="http://qt.gitorious.org/qt">http://qt.gitorious.org/qt</ulink>.</para></note>

<para>In order to build &Qt;, you should make sure that the
<link linkend="conf-qtdir">qtdir</link> setting is set to the directory you'd
like to install &Qt; to, as described in <xref linkend="configure-data"/>.</para>

<para>You should then ensure that the qt-copy module is added to
your <filename>.kdesrc-buildrc</filename>, before any other modules in the
file. If you are using the sample configuration file, you can simply
uncomment the existing qt-copy module entry.</para>

<para>Now you should verify the <link
linkend="conf-repository">repository</link> option and <link
linkend="conf-branch">branch</link> options are set appropriately:</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>The first option is to build &Qt; using a mirror maintained
on the &kde; source repositories (no other changes are applied, it is simply
a clone of the official source). This is highly recommended due to occasional
issues with cloning the full &Qt; module from its official repository.</para>

<para>You can set the <option>repository</option> option for the qt-copy
module to <userinput>kde:qt</userinput> to use this option.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para>Otherwise, to build the standard &Qt;, set your
<option>repository</option> option to
<userinput>git://gitorious.org/qt/qt.git</userinput>. Note that you may
experience problems performing the initial clone of &Qt; from this
repository.</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>In both cases, the branch option should be set to <userinput>master</userinput> (unless you'd
like to build a different branch).</para>

<sect2 id="build-priority">
<title>Changing &kdesrc-build;'s build priority</title>
<para>Programs can run with different priority levels on Operating Systems,
including &Linux; and &BSD;. This allows the system to allocate time for the
different programs in accordance with how important they are.
</para>

<para>&kdesrc-build; will normally allocate itself a low priority so that the
rest of the programs on your system are unaffected and can run normally.
Using this technique, &kdesrc-build; will use extra CPU when it is available.
</para>

<para>&kdesrc-build; will still maintain a high enough priority level so that
it runs before routine batch processes and before CPU donation programs
such as <ulink url="http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/">Seti@Home</ulink>.
</para>

<para>To alter &kdesrc-build; so that it uses a higher (or lower) priority
level permanently, then you need to adjust the &niceness; setting in the <link
linkend="configure-data">configuration file</link>. The &niceness; setting
controls how <quote>nice</quote> &kdesrc-build; is to other programs. In other
words, having a higher &niceness; gives &kdesrc-build; a lower priority. So to
give &kdesrc-build; a higher priority, reduce the &niceness; (and vice versa).
The &niceness; can go from 0 (not nice at all, highest priority) to 20 (super
nice, lowest priority).</para>

<para>You can also temporarily change the priority for &kdesrc-build; by using
the &cmd-nice; <link linkend="cmdline">command line option</link>. The value to
the option is used exactly the same as for &niceness;.</para>

<note><para>It is possible for some programs run by the super user to have a
negative nice value, with a correspondingly even higher priority for such
programs. Setting a negative (or even 0) &niceness; for &kdesrc-build; is not
a great idea, as it will not help run time significantly, but will make your
computer seem very sluggish should you still need to use it.
</para></note>

<informalexample>
<para>To run &kdesrc-build; with a niceness of 15 (a lower priority than
normal):</para>

<screen>
<prompt>&percnt;</prompt> <userinput><command>kdesrc-build</command> <option>--nice=<replaceable>15</replaceable></option></userinput>
</screen>

<para>Or, you can edit the <link linkend="configure-data">configuration file</link> to make the change permanent:</para>

<screen>
    &niceness; <replaceable>15</replaceable>
</screen>
</informalexample>

<tip>
<para>The <link linkend="conf-niceness">niceness</link> option only affects the
usage of the computer's processor(s). One other major affect on computer
performance relates to how much data input or output (<acronym>I/O</acronym>) a
program uses. In order to control how much <acronym>I/O</acronym> a program can
use, modern &Linux; operating systems support a similar tool called
<application>ionice</application>. &kdesrc-build; supports
<application>ionice</application>, (but only to enable or disable it
completely) using the <link
linkend="conf-use-idle-io-priority">use-idle-io-priority</link> option,
since &kdesrc-build; version 1.12.
</para>
</tip>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="root-installation">
<title>Installation as the superuser</title>
<para>You may wish to have &kdesrc-build; run the installation with super user
privileges. This may be for the unrecommended system-wide installation.
This is also useful when using a recommended single user &kde; build, however.
This is because some modules (especially kdebase) install programs that will
briefly need elevated permissions when run. They are not able to achieve these
permission levels unless they are installed with the elevated permissions.
</para>

<para>You could simply run &kdesrc-build; as the super user directly, but this
is not recommended, since the program has not been audited for that kind of use.
Although it should be safe to run the program in this fashion, it is better to
avoid running as the super user when possible.</para>

<para>To take care of this, &kdesrc-build; provides the &make-install-prefix;
option. You can use this option to specify a command to use to perform the
installation as another user. The recommended way to use this command is with
the &sudo; program, which will run the install command as the super user.
</para>

<informalexample>
<para>For example, to install all modules using &sudo;,
you could do something like this:</para>

<screen>
global
  &make-install-prefix; <replaceable>sudo</replaceable>
  # Other options
end global
</screen>

<para>To use &make-install-prefix; for only a single module, this would work:
</para>

<screen>
module <replaceable>svn-module-name</replaceable>
  &make-install-prefix; <replaceable>sudo</replaceable>
end module
</screen>

<sect2 id="build-progress">
<title>Showing the progress of a module build</title>

<sect1 id="advanced-features">
<title>Advanced features</title>

<sect2 id="partial-builds">
<title>Partially building a module</title>
<para>It is possible to build only pieces from a single &kde; module. For
example, you may want to compile only one program from a module. &kdesrc-build;
has features to make this easy. There are several complementing ways to
do this.
</para>

<sect3 id="checking-out-parts">
<title>Checking out portions of a module</title>

<para>This is perhaps the best way to do this. When it works, it will save you
download time and disk space. What happens is that &kdesrc-build; will download
only the parts of a module that you specify. This is done using the &checkout-only;
option for a module, which will specify a list of directories to download.
</para>

<tip><para>
If you do not already know what to download from a module, it may be a good idea
to browse the &subversion; layout for a module first, using
<ulink url="http://websvn.kde.org/branches/KDE/4.6/">WebSVN</ulink>.
</para></tip>

<informalexample>
<para>To only grab &kuser; and <application>KSystemLog</application> from
kdeadmin, you could use &checkout-only; like this:</para>

<screen>
module <replaceable>kdeadmin</replaceable>
  &checkout-only; <replaceable>kuser ksystemlog</replaceable>
end module
</screen>

</informalexample>

<important><para>The directories will be built in the order they are listed
in the option. If one of the directories needs something else from the module
to compile, then you need to make sure they are both in the &checkout-only;
line, and that the required dependency goes before the directory that needs it.</para>

<para>Also, sometimes an application may need other directories and it is hard
to figure out what they are, which may require some trial and error of constantly
adding directories to the option to figure out. This option depends on support
from the build system of the module, so it is only useful for modules that are
collections of individual applications.</para>
</important>

<para>One final note to make about this option: If you change the value of this
option, you should use <userinput><command>kdesrc-build</command>
<option>&cmd-refresh-build;</option> <option><replaceable>module</replaceable></option></userinput>
in order to ensure that the module is reconfigured properly. In addition,
&kdesrc-build; will never remove existing files if you take away the number of
directories from your &checkout-only; option, or add the option to a module that
has already been checked out.</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 id="not-compiling">
<title>Removing directories from a build</title>
<para>Instead of restricting what is downloaded, it is possible to download
everything but have the build system leave out a few directories when it does
the build. This may be useful if one directory always breaks and is
unnecessary to the rest of the module.
</para>

<para>This is controlled with the &do-not-compile; option. It works similar
to the &checkout-only; option just described, in that it is simply a list of
directories that should not be compiled.</para>

<important><para>
Also like &checkout-only;, this option requires at least that the
build system for the module is reconfigured after changing
it. This is done using the <userinput><command>kdesrc-build</command>
<option>&cmd-reconfigure;</option>
<option><replaceable>module</replaceable></option></userinput> command.
</para></important>

<informalexample>
<para>To remove the <filename class="directory">python</filename> directory
from the kdebindings build process:</para>

<screen>
module <replaceable>kdebindings</replaceable>
  &do-not-compile; <replaceable>python</replaceable>
end module
</screen>

<note><para>This function depends on some standard conventions used in most
&kde; modules. Therefore it may not work for all programs.</para></note>

<sect2 id="using-branches">
<title>Branching and tagging support for &kdesrc-build;</title>

<sect3 id="branches-and-tags">
<title>What are branches and tags?</title>

<para>&subversion; supports managing the history of the &kde; source code. &kde;
uses this support to create branches for development, and to tag the repository
every so often with a new version release.
</para>

<para>For example, the &kmail; developers may be working on a new feature in
a different branch in order to avoid breaking the version being used by most
developers. This branch has development ongoing inside it, even while the
main branch (called /trunk) may have development going on inside of it.
</para>

<para>A tag, on the other hand, is a snapshot of the source code repository
at a position in time. This is used by the &kde; administration team to mark
off a version of code suitable for release and still allow the developers to
work on the code.
</para>

<para>In &subversion;, there is no difference between branches, tags, or trunk within
the code. It is only a convention used by the developers. This makes it
difficult to properly support branches and tags within &kdesrc-build;. However,
there are some things that can be done.
</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 id="branch-support">
<title>How to use branches and tags</title>

<para>Support for branches and tags is handled by a set of options, which
range from a generic request for a version, to a specific &url; to download
for advanced users.
</para>

<para>The easiest method is to use the &branch; and &tag; options. You simply
use the option along with the name of the desired branch or tag for a module,
and &kdesrc-build; will try to determine the appropriate location within the
&kde; repository to download from. For most &kde; modules this works very
well.</para>

<informalexample>
<para>To download kdelibs from &kde; 4.6 (which is simply known as the 4.6 branch):
</para>

<screen>
module kdelibs
  branch <replaceable>4.6</replaceable>
  # other options...
end module
</screen>

<para>Or, to download kdemultimedia as it was released with &kde; 4.6.1:</para>

<screen>
module kdemultimedia
  tag <replaceable>4.6.1</replaceable>
  # other options...
end module
</screen>

</informalexample>

<tip><para>You can specify a global branch value. But if you do so, do not forget
to specify a different branch for modules that should not use the global branch!
</para></tip>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="advanced-branches">
<title>Advanced branch support options</title>

<para>&kdesrc-build; supports two options for situations where &branch; and &tag;
guess the correct path improperly: &module-base-path; and &override-url;.
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>
&module-base-path; is used to help &kdesrc-build; fill in the missing part of
a module's path. In the &kde; repository, all of the paths are of the form
<filename class="directory">svnRoot/module-base-path/<replaceable>module-name</replaceable></filename>. Normally &kdesrc-build;
can figure out the appropriate middle part by itself. When it cannot, you can use
&module-base-path;, like this:
</para>

<informalexample>
<screen>
module kdesupport
    # kdesupport supports various tags to easily organize the required
    # software for a given KDE Platform release.
    module-base-path tags/kdesupport-for-4.5
end module
</screen>

<para>This would cause &kdesrc-build; to download kdesupport from (in this example),
<filename>svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/<replaceable>tags/kdesupport-for-4.5</replaceable></filename>.
</para>
</informalexample>
<tip><para>In previous versions of &kdesrc-build;, the &module-base-path; was
handled differently. If you encounter trouble using an old module-base-path
definition perhaps you should verify that the actual path is as &kdesrc-build;
expects by using the <link linkend="cmdline-pretend">--pretend</link> option.
</para></tip>
</listitem>

<listitem><para>The &override-url; option, on the other hand, requires you to
specify the exact path to download from. However, this allows you to pull from
paths that previous versions of &kdesrc-build; would have no hope of downloading from.
Currently, the &module-base-path; option should be sufficient for any Subversion
source URL.
</para>

<important><para>
&kdesrc-build; will not touch or correct the value you specify for &override-url;

<para>&kdesrc-build; used to include features to automatically attempt to

the build system no longer suffers from these bugs, and so &kdesrc-build; will
not try to build a module more than once. There are situations where
&kdesrc-build; will automatically take action though:</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>If you change <link linkend="conf-configure-flags">configure-flags</link>

<title>Manually rebuilding a module</title>
<para>If you make a change to a module's option settings, or the module's

<para>You can do this by simply running <userinput><command>kdesrc-build</command>
 <option>--refresh-build</option> <option><replaceable>module</replaceable></option></userinput>.
</para>

<para>If you would like to have &kdesrc-build; automatically rebuild the module
during the next normal build update instead, you can create a special file.
Every module has a build directory. If you create a file called <filename>.refresh-me</filename>
in the build directory for a module, &kdesrc-build; will rebuild the module
next time the build process occurs, even if it would normally perform the
faster incremental build.</para>

<tip>
<para>By default, the build directory is <filename class="directory">~/kdesrc/build/<replaceable>module</replaceable>/</filename>.

script generates. In any case, errors will always be output.</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>The <option>--quiet</option> option (short form is
<option>-q</option>) causes &kdesrc-build; to be mostly silent. Only important
messages, warnings, or errors will be shown. When available, build progress
information is still shown.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The <option>--really-quiet</option> option (no short form)
causes &kdesrc-build; to only display important warnings or errors while it is
running.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The <option>--verbose</option> option (short form is
<option>-v</option>) causes &kdesrc-build; to be very detailed in its
output.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The <option>--debug</option> option is for debugging purposes
only, it causes &kdesrc-build; to act as if <option>--verbose</option> was
turned on, causes commands to also output to the terminal, and will display
debugging information for many functions.</para></listitem>

<title>Color output</title>
<para>When being run from &konsole; or a different terminal, &kdesrc-build;
will normally display with colorized text.</para>

<para>You can disable this by using the <option>--no-color</option> on the
command line, or by setting the &colorful-output; option in the <link linkend="configure-data">configuration file</link> to
<userinput>false</userinput>.

<title>Removing unneeded directories after a build</title>
<para>Are you short on disk space but still want to run a bleeding-edge
&kde; checkout?  &kdesrc-build; can help reduce your disk usage when building
&kde; from &subversion;.</para>

<note><para>Be aware that building &kde; does take a lot of space. There are
several major space-using pieces when using &kdesrc-build;:</para></note>

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>The actual source checkout can take up a fair amount of space.
The default modules take up about 1.6 gigabytes of on-disk space. You can reduce
this amount by making sure that you are only building as many modules as you
actually want. &kdesrc-build; will not delete source code from disk even if you
delete the entry from the <link linkend="configure-data">configuration file</link>, so make sure that you go and delete unused
source checkouts from the source directory. Note that the source files are
downloaded from the Internet, you <emphasis>should not</emphasis> delete them
if you are actually using them, at least until you are done using
&kdesrc-build;.</para>

<para>Also, if you already have a &Qt; installed by your distribution (and
the odds are good that you do), you probably do not need to install the
qt-copy module. That will shave about 200 megabytes off of the on-disk source
size.</para>

<para>One thing to note is that due to the way &subversion; works: there are actually
two files on disk for every file checked-out from the repository. &kdesrc-build;
does not have code at this point to try and minimize the source size when the
source is not being used.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>&kdesrc-build; will create a separate build directory to build the source
code in. Sometimes &kdesrc-build; will have to copy a source directory to
create a fake build directory. When this happens, space-saving symlinks are
used, so this should not be a hassle on disk space. The build directory will
typically be much larger than the source directory for a module. For example,
the build directory for kdebase is about 1050 megabytes, whereas kdebase's
source is only around 550 megabytes.</para>

<para>Luckily, the build directory is not required after a module has
successfully been built and installed. &kdesrc-build; can automatically
remove the build directory after installing a module, see the examples below
for more information. Note that taking this step will make it impossible
for &kdesrc-build; to perform the time-saving incremental builds.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para>
Finally, there is disk space required for the actual installation of
&kde;, which does not run from the build directory. This typically takes less
space than the build directory. It is harder to get exact figures however.
</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>How do you reduce the space requirements of &kde;?  One way is to
use the proper compiler flags, to optimize for space reduction instead of
for speed. Another way, which can have a large effect, is to remove debugging
information from your &kde; build.
</para>

<warning><para>
You should be very sure you know what you are doing before deciding to remove
debugging information. Running bleeding-edge software means you are running
software which is potentially much more likely to crash than a stable release.
If you are running software without debugging information, it can be very
hard to create a good bug report to get your bug resolved, and you will likely
have to re-enable debugging information for the affected application and
rebuild to help a developer fix the crash. So, remove debugging information
at your own risk!
</para></warning>

<informalexample>
<para>Removing the build directory after installation of a module. The source
directory is still kept, and debugging is enabled:</para>

<screen>
global
  configure-flags      --enable-debug
  remove-after-install builddir        # Remove build directory after install
end global
</screen>

<para>Removing the build directory after installation, without debugging
information, with size optimization.</para>

<title>Introduction to &cmake;</title>

<para>In March 2006, the &cmake; program
beat out several competitors and was selected to be the build system for &kde; 4, replacing the
autotools-based system that &kde; has used from the beginning.</para>

<para>A introduction to &cmake; page is available on the <ulink
url="http://techbase.kde.org/Development/Tutorials/CMake">&kde; TechBase</ulink>.
Basically, instead of running <userinput><command>make</command> <option>-f</option>
<filename>Makefile.cvs</filename></userinput>, then <command>configure</command>,
then &make;, we simply run &cmake; and then &make;.
</para>

<para>&kdesrc-build; has support for &cmake;. A few features of &kdesrc-build;
were really features of the underlying buildsystem, including
<link linkend="conf-configure-flags">configure-flags</link>
and <link linkend="conf-do-not-compile">do-not-compile</link>. When equivalent
features are available, they are provided. For instance, the equivalent to the
configure-flags option is <link linkend="conf-cmake-options">cmake-options</link>, and the
<link linkend="conf-do-not-compile">do-not-compile</link> option is also supported for &cmake;
as of &kdesrc-build; version 1.6.3.
