# Sample configuration file for kdesvn-build.
#
# To use this sample configuration file, copy it to ~/.kdesvn-buildrc, and then
# edit it to suit your desires.

# Global settings go in this section.  They apply to every module unless
# overridden later.
global

# This is the directory that your KDE sources are downloaded to.  This
# directory also holds the build and log directories by default.
#	source-dir ~/kdesvn

# This is the directory that KDE will end up installed at.  The default is
# appropriate for a single-user installation of KDE, which requires no root
# permissions.  If you'd like, you can install and use the sudo program to
# install KDE anywhere on your system, in conjunction with the
# make-install-prefix option.
#	kdedir ~/kde
#
# You can overwrite the installation directory for a given module using
# the per-module "prefix" option. Note that when doing this you need to
# set KDEDIRS, PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to both directories,
# and that you should use separate test users or KDEHOME values to separate
# the ksycoca databases. Only set prefix if you know what you're doing.

# This is the Qt installation to use to build KDE.  The default is qt-copy
# from Subversion.  Qt will be installed to this directory, so it is
# recommended to use something like ~/qt-4.
# KDE /trunk requires a very recent Qt so qt-copy is the best route if you're
# building /trunk.  If you are building an older branch you may use your
# system installed Qt by setting qtdir to point to it (what qmake -v
# reports with the /lib removed).
	qtdir ~/qt4  # Default to installing Qt

# By default (if the above is commented out), you are getting trunk.
# If instead you want to check out another branch, like 4.2, use
#	branch 4.2
#
# but also see the qt-copy and kdesupport modules below, which has special
# requirements

# This is the Subversion server to download the KDE sources from.  Developers:
# Don't forget to add your username to the URL if necessary!
#	svn-server svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde

# cmake-options controls the compilation options for building KDE 4 modules.
# These options apply to all KDE modules unless otherwise specified.
# NOTE: If you want the cxxflags option below to work (advanced users only)
# then make sure to set the "-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=none" here, or in the specific
# module's cmake-options
#
# Also see http://techbase.kde.org/Development/Tutorials/CMake#Command_Line_Variables
#	cmake-options -DKDE4_BUILD_TESTS:BOOL=ON
	cmake-options -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo

# These are the default options passed to the make command.  The default tries
# to build with 2 parallel compiles.  If you are using distcc or have SMP, you
# should experiment with setting this value higher for best performance.
#	make-options -j2

# KDE has one of the most extensive translation packages in the world.  They
# are stored in the l10n module.  kdesvn-build can automatically try to build
# and install languages for you, using this parameter.  It should be a list
# of languages to build and install.  This option requires the language code
# as present in l10n.  You can look these codes up at
# http://i18n.kde.org/teams/
#	kde-languages de        # German
#	kde-languages fr        # French
#	kde-languages en_GB cs  # British English and Czech

# If you would like install KDE to the system (DO NOT INSTALL *over* a prior
# installation!), then you'll probably need to use sudo to install everything.
#
# The -S parameter causes sudo to read from standard input (which is redirected
# by kdesvn-build).  This means that if sudo has to ask for your password, it
# will fail, you need to configure sudo to be able to run "make install" and
# without requesting a password.
#
# In addition, you can run kdesvn-build --no-install, and then
# sudo kdesvn-build --install if you are unable to configure sudo to allow
# make install with no password.
#	 make-install-prefix sudo -S

# purge-old-logs controls whether old log files should be removed after the
# latest build finishes. Set to true to enable it.
#	 purge-old-logs false

# binpath controls the value of the PATH environment variable during
# compilation.  If you have unusual tools that need to be in the path to build
# KDE, add them here.  KDE's and Qt's programs are automatically added.
# If you leave this option blank, it will default to the PATH that kdesvn-build had
# when it was started.
#	binpath /bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin
#	binpath /usr/lib/ccache/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin

# This directory is where everything gets built before it is installed.  By
# default it is relative to the value for source-dir.  You can specify an
# absolute path if you'd like (begin the path with a slash).
#	build-dir build

# These are the compilation flags to use by default when compiling KDE.
# gcc supports a -march option in order to generate specific code for pentium4, athlon-xp,
# etc.  See the gcc man page for more information.
#
# NOTE: For KDE 4 these flags are only applied if you set the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE setting
# to "none" (see the cmake-options setting)
#	cxxflags -pipe -march=native # Don't use native with distributed build

# You can use the set-env option to add values to the build environment.
#	set-env LDFLAGS -Wl,-O1   # Optimize the linker, takes longer.

# If you use software which requires pkg-config, and you need to add entries
# to your pkg-config path, you can also use set-env for that.  Some broken
# systems require you to set this to find e.g. glib.
#	set-env PKG_CONFIG_PATH /opt/gnome/lib/pkgconfig
end global

# qt-copy is a copy of Trolltech's Qt, optionally with some bugfixes and
# optimizations added.  It is the easiest way to get Qt if you don't already
