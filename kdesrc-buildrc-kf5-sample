    # in doubt, run "nproc" to see how many cores you have)

    # qtwebengine, though you can use it for modules yourself. A conservative

# Uncomment this if you want kdesrc-build to try to install Qt5.  We recommend
# your distribution's Qt5 *development* packages instead though, if recent enough.
#
# NOTE: You MUST change the path below to include the actual path to your
# kdesrc-build installation.
#include ~/kde5/src/kdesrc-build/qt5-build-include

# Instead of specifying modules here, the current best practice is to refer to
# KF5 module lists maintained with kdesrc-build by the KF5 developers. As new
# modules are added or modified, the kdesrc-build KF5 module list is altered to
# suit, and when you update kdesrc-build you will automatically pick up the
# needed changes.

# NOTE: You MUST change the path below to include the actual path to your
# kdesrc-build installation.
include ~/kde5/src/kdesrc-build/kf5-qt5-build-include

# If you wish to maintain the module list yourself that is possible, simply
# look at the files pointed to above and use the "module-set" declarations that
# they use, with your own changes.

# It is possible to change the options for modules loaded from the file
# included above (since it's not possible to add a module that's already been
# included), e.g.
options kcoreaddons
    make-options -j4
end options
