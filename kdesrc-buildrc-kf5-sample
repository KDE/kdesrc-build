# This is a sample kdesrc-build configuration file appropriate for KDE
# Frameworks 5-based build environments.

    kdedir ~/kde-5 # Where to install KF5-based software
    # Uncomment this and edit value to choose a different Qt5
#    qtdir /usr     # Where to find Qt5

    # Where to download source code. By default the build directory and
    # logs will be kept under this directory as well.
    source-dir ~/kde/src

    # These values should be set to the number of cores to use during build (if
    # in doubt, run "nproc" to see how many cores you have)
    num-cores 4

    # This is the same as above but used for heavyweight modules like
    # qtwebengine, though you can use it for modules yourself. A conservative
    # thumbrule is one core for every 2 GiB of total memory.
    num-cores-low-mem 2
end global

# Instead of specifying modules here, the current best practice is to refer to
# KF5 module lists maintained with kdesrc-build by the KF5 developers. As new
# modules are added or modified, the kdesrc-build KF5 module list is altered to
# suit, and when you update kdesrc-build you will automatically pick up the
# needed changes.

# NOTE: You MUST change the path below to include the actual path to your
# kdesrc-build installation.
include /path/to/kdesrc-build/kf5-qt5-build-include

# If you wish to maintain the module list yourself that is possible, simply
# look at the files pointed to above and use the "module-set" declarations that
# they use, with your own changes.

# It is possible to change the options for modules loaded from the file
# included above (since it's not possible to add a module that's already been
# included), e.g.
options kcoreaddons
    make-options -j4
end options

# kate: syntax kdesrc-buildrc;
