### Script-global functions.

# These functions might be called at runtime via log_command, using
# log_command's support for symbolic execution of a named subroutine. Because
# of that, they have been left in the top-level script.
#
# Everything else should be in an appropriate class.

# Subroutine to recursively symlink a directory into another location, in a
# similar fashion to how the XFree/X.org lndir() program does it.  This is
# reimplemented here since some systems lndir doesn't seem to work right.
#
# Used from ksb::l10nSystem
#
# As a special exception to the GNU GPL, you may use and redistribute this
# function however you would like (i.e. consider it public domain).
#
# The first parameter is the directory to symlink from.
# The second parameter is the destination directory name.
#
# e.g. if you have $from/foo and $from/bar, lndir would create $to/foo and
# $to/bar.
#
# All intervening directories will be created as needed.  In addition, you
# may safely run this function again if you only want to catch additional files
# in the source directory.
#
# Note that this function will unconditionally output the files/directories
# created, as it is meant to be a close match to lndir.
#
# RETURN VALUE: Boolean true (non-zero) if successful, Boolean false (0, "")
