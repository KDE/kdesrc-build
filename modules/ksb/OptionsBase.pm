=head1 OptionsBase

A class that encapsulates generic option-handling tasks for kdesrc-build, used
to implement common functions within C<BuildContext>, C<Module>, and C<ModuleSet>.

There is some internal trickery to ensure that program code can override
user-selected options in certain situations, which is why we don't simply
use a hash table directly. These are the so-called 'sticky' options, seen
internally as options with a name starting with #.

=head2 METHODS

=over

=item new

Creates a new C<OptionsBase>.

 my $self = OptionsBase->new();

=item hasOption

Returns true if the given option is present in the collection of options,
B<even if the value is C<undef>>.

=item hasStickyOption

Returns true if the given option has been overridden by a 'sticky' option.
Use C<getOption> to return the actual value in this case.

=item getOption

Returns the value of the given option. 'Sticky' options are returned in
preference to this object's own option (this allows you to temporarily
override an option with a sticky option without overwriting the option
value). If no such option is present, returns an empty string.

Note that C<Module> has its own, much more involved override of this
method. Note further that although C<undef> is not returned directly by
this method, that it's possible for sticky options to be set to undef (if
you're setting sticky option values, it's probably best not to do that).

=item setOption

Sets the given option(s) to the given values.

 $self->setOption(%options);

Normally seen as simply:

 $self->setOption($option, $value);

For the vast majority of possible options, setting the same option again
overwrites any previous value. However for C<set-env> options, additional
option sets instead will B<append> to previously-set values.

If you need to perform special handling based on option values, subclass
this function, but be sure to call B<this> setOption() with the resulting
set of options (if any are left to set).

=item deleteOption

Removes the given option (and its value), if present.

=item mergeOptionsFrom

Merges options from the given C<OptionsBase>, replacing any options already
present (but keeping other existing options). Nice to quickly setup an options
baseline to make small changes afterwards without having to worry about
aliasing the other module's option set.

=back

=head2 INTENT

This module is mostly used to encapsulate common code for handling module and
module-set options, for use by major subclasses.

The code in this class simply gets/sets options. To parse options and determine
what options to set, see L<ksb::Application> and its friends.
