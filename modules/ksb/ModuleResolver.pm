__END__

=head1 ModuleResolver

A class that handles general management tasks associated with the
module build list, including option handling and resolution of module
selectors into actual modules.

=head2 METHODS

=over

=item new

Creates a new C<ModuleResolver>. You must pass the appropriate
C<BuildContext> Don't forget to call setPendingOptions(),
setIgnoredSelectors() and setInputModulesAndOptions().

 my $resolver = ModuleResolver->new($ctx);

=item setPendingOptions

Sets the options that should be applied to modules when they are created.
No special handling for global options is performed here (but see
ksb::OptionsBase::getOption and its friends).

You should pass in a hashref, where module-names are keys to values which
are themselves hashrefs of option-name => value pairs:

 $resolver->setPendingOptions(
    { mod1 => { 'cmake-options' => 'foo', ... },
      mod2 => { }
    })

=item setIgnoredSelectors

Declares all selectors that should be ignored by default in the process of
expanding module sets. Any modules matching these selectors would be elided
from any expanded module sets by default.

You should pass a listref of selectors.

=item setInputModulesAndOptions

Declares the list of all modules and module-sets known to the program,
along with their base options. Modules should be ksb::Module objects,
module-sets should be ksb::ModuleSet objects, no other types should be
present in the list.

You should pass a listref of Modules or ModuleSets (as appropriate).

=item resolveSelectorsIntoModules

Resolves the given list of module selectors into ksb::Module objects,
using the pending command-line options, ignore-selectors and available
modules/module-sets.

Selectors always choose an available ksb::Module or ksb::ModuleSet if
present (based on the name() of each Module or ModuleSet, including any
use-modules entries for ModuleSet objects). If a selector cannot be
directly found then ModuleSet objects may be expanded into their
constituent Module objects and the search performed again. If a selector
still cannot be found an exception is thrown.

Any embedded ModuleSets are expanded to Modules in the return value.

The list of selected Modules is returned, in the approximate order of the
input list (selectors for module-sets are expanded in arbitrary order).

If you are just looking for a Module that should already be present, see
resolveModuleIfPresent().

 my @modules = eval { $resolver->resolveSelectorsIntoModules('kdelibs', 'juk'); }

=item resolveModuleIfPresent

Similar to resolveSelectorsIntoModules(), except that no exceptions are
thrown if the module doesn't exist. Only a single module name is supported.

=item expandModuleSets

Converts any ksb::ModuleSet objects in the given list of Modules and
ModuleSets into their component ksb::Module objects (with proper options
set, and ignored modules not present). These component objects are spliced
into the list of module-type objects, replacing the ModuleSet they came
from.

The list of ksb::Module objects is then returned. The list passed in is
not actually modified in this process.

=back

=head2 IMPLEMENTATION

This module uses a multi-pass option resolving system, in accordance with
the way kdesrc-build handles options. Consider a simple kdesrc-buildrc:

 global
     cmake-options -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
     ...
 end global

 module-set ms-foo
     cmake-options -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
     repository kde-projects
     use-modules kde/kdemultimedia
     include-dependencies true
 end module-set

 options framework1
     set-env BUILD_DEBUG 1
 end options

 module taglib
     repository git://...
     branch 1.6
 end module

 options juk
     cxxflags -g3 -Og
     custom-build-command ninja
 end options

In this case we'd expect that a module like taglib ends up with its
C<cmake-options> derived from the global section directly, while all modules
included from module set C<ms-foo> use the C<cmake-options> defined in the
module-set.

At the same time we'd expect that juk has all the options listed in ms-foo, but
also the specific C<cxxflags> and C<custom-build-command> options shown,
I<no matter how> the juk module had been referenced during the build.

There are many ways to convince kdesrc-build to add a module into its build list:

=over

=item 1. Mention it directly on the command line.

=item 2. Include it in the kdesrc-buildrc file, either as a new C<module> block or
in a C<use-modules> of a C<module-set>.

=item 3. For KDE modules, mention a component of its project path in a
C<use-modules> declaration within a C<kde-projects>-based module set. E.g. the
"kde/kdemultimedia" entry above, which will pull in the juk module even though
"juk" is not named directly.

=item 4. For KDE modules, by being a dependency of a module included from a
C<module-set> where the C<include-dependencies> option is set to C<true>. This
wouldn't apply to juk, but might apply to modules such as phonon. Note that
"taglib" in this example would B<not> be a dependency of juk according to
kdesrc-build (although it is in reality), since taglib is not a KDE module.

=back

This mission of this class is to ensure that, no matter I<how> a module ended
up being selected by the user for the build list, that the same options are
registered into the module, the module uses the same build and scm types, is
defaulted to the right build phases, etc.

To do this, this class takes the read-in options, modules, and module sets from
the rc-file, the list of "selectors" requested by the user (via cmdline), any
changes to the options from the cmdline, and then takes pains to ensure that
any requested modules are returned via the appropriate module-set (and if no
module-set can source the module, via default options).

In doing so, the class must keep track of module sets, the modules included
into each module set, and modules that were mentioned somehow but not
already present in the known list of modules (or module sets).

Since module sets can cause modules to be defined that are not mentioned
anywhere within an rc-file, it may be required to completely expand all
module sets in order to verify that a referenced C<Module> is B<not>
already known.

=head2 OUTPUTS

From the perspective of calling code, the 'outputs' of this module are
lists of C<Module> objects, in the order they were selected (or mentioned
in the rc-file). See expandModuleSets() and resolveSelectorsIntoModules().

Each object so returned should already have the appropriate options
included (based on the cmdlineOptions member, which should be constructed
as the union of rc-file and cmdline options).

Note that dependency resolution is B<not> handled by this module, see
C<DependencyResolver> for that.
