=head2 super_mkdir

Creates a directory, including any parent directories that may also need

=head2 filter_program_output

Returns an array of lines output from a program.  Use this only if you expect
that the output after filtering will be short.

 my $filter = sub { return 1 if /^U/ };
 my @output = filter_program_output($filter, 'git', 'describe', 'HEAD');

Since there is no way to disambiguate no output from an error, this function
will call C<die> on error, wrap in C<eval> if this bugs you.

First parameter is subroutine reference to use as a filter (this sub will
be passed a line at a time and should return true if the line should be
returned).  If no filtering is desired pass C<undef>.

Second parameter is the program to run (either full path or something
accessible in $PATH).

All remaining arguments are passed to the program.

=head2 await_promise

Takes a promise on input and calls ->wait on it, blocking until the promise
resolves.  Returns the promise passed in.

You should not use this function except as a porting aid to convert
log_command()-based async code to use promises.

Throws an exception if the I/O loop is already in operation, as this indicates
serious bugs.

=cut

sub await_promise ($promise)
{
    croak_internal("Tried to await a promise when I/O loop active!")
        if $promise->ioloop->is_running;
    $promise->wait;
    return $promise;
}

=head2 await_exitcode

Takes a promise on input, adds a handler to extract the final result (treating
it as a shell-style exit code), and calls ->wait on it, blocking until the
promise resolves or rejects.

You should not use this function except as a porting aid to convert
log_command()-based async code to use promises.

Returns a boolean value (true if the promise exitcode resolved to 0, false
otherwise).

Throws an exception if the I/O loop is already in operation, as this indicates
serious bugs.

=cut

sub await_exitcode ($promise)
{
    my $result;
    await_promise($promise->then(sub ($exitcode) {
        $result = ($exitcode == 0);
    }));
    return $result;
}

=head2 await_result

Takes a promise on input, adds a handler to extract the final result (as a
scalar), and calls ->wait on it, blocking until the promise resolves or
rejects.

You should not use this function except as a porting aid to convert
log_command()-based async code to use promises.

Returns the scalar result.

Throws an exception if the I/O loop is already in operation, as this indicates
serious bugs.

=cut

sub await_result ($promise)
{
    my $result;
    await_promise($promise->then(sub ($result_from_p) {
        $result = $result_from_p;
    }));
    return $result;
}

=head2 log_command

Subroutine to run a command, optionally filtering on the output of the child
command. Use like:

 my $exitcode = log_command($module, 'build-output', [qw(make -j4)]);

After the required three parameters (module, base name for log file, and a list
with the command and arguments) you can pass a hash reference of optional
features:

=over

=item C<callback =E<gt> sub ($line) { ... }>

A reference to a subroutine to have each line of child output passed to.  This
output is not supposed to be printed to the screen by the subroutine, normally
the output is only logged.  However this is useful for e.g. munging out the
progress of the build.

If you wish to run short commands and look through their output, prefer
L<"filter_program_output"> instead, as this disables message translation.

=for comment
#  'no_translate' => any true value will cause a flag to be set to request
#  the executed child process to not translate (for locale purposes) its
#  output, so that it can be screen-scraped.

=back

The return value is the shell return code, so 0 is success, and non-zero is
  failure.

I<NOTE>: This function has a special feature.  If the command passed into the
argument reference is 'kdesrc-build', then log_command will, when it forks,
execute the subroutine named by the second parameter rather than executing a
child process.  The subroutine should include the full package name as well
(otherwise the package containing log_command's implementation is used).  The
remaining arguments in the list are passed to the subroutine that is called.

=head3 Pretend handling

The program is not actually executed in pretend mode.  If you need the program
to always be run, use a Perl IPC mechanism like L<system|perlfunc/"system"> or
a utility like L<"filter_program_output">.

=cut

sub log_command ($module, $filename, $argRef, $optionsRef = {})
{
    my @command     = @{$argRef};
    my $callbackRef = $optionsRef->{'callback'};

    debug ("log_command(): Module $module, Command: ", join(' ', @command));

    if (pretending()) {
        pretend ("\tWould have run g['" . join ("' '", @command) . "'");
        return 0;
    }

    return run_logged_command($module, $filename, $callbackRef, @{$argRef});
}

=head2 run_logged_p

This is similar to C<log_command> in that this runs the given command and
arguments in a separate process. The difference is that this command
I<does not wait> for the process to finish, and instead returns a
L<Mojo::Promise> that resolves to the exit status of the sub-process.

Another important difference is that fewer options are currently supported.
In particular there is no built-in way to filter the program output or to
force off locale translations.

This is useful in permitting concurrent code without needing to resolve
significant changes from a separate thread of execution over time.

Note that concurrent code should be careful about accessing global state
simultaneously. This includes things like the current working directory, which
is shared across the entire process.  run_logged_p allows you to pass a param
to set the working directory to use in the *subprocess* it creates so that
there is no contention over the main process's current working directory.
If the C<$dir> param is C<undef> then the directory is not changed.

 my $builddir = $module->fullpath('build'); # need to pass dir to use
 my $promise = run_logged_p($module, 'build', $builddir, [qw(make -j8)]);
 $promise->then(sub ($result) {
   say "Process result: $result";
 })->wait;

# Function: pretend_open

# Opens the given file and returns a filehandle to it if the file actually
# exists or the script is not in pretend mode. If the script is in pretend mode
# and the file is not already present then an open filehandle to an empty
# string is returned.
#
# Parameters:
#  filename - Path to the file to open.
#  default  - String to use if the file doesn't exist in pretend mode
#
# Returns:
#  filehandle on success (supports readline() and eof()), can return boolean
#  false if there is an error opening an existing file (or if the file doesn't
#  exist when not in pretend mode)

=head2 safe_lndir_p

Subroutine to recursively symlink a directory into another location, in a
similar fashion to how the XFree/X.org lndir() program does it.  This is
reimplemented here since some systems lndir doesn't seem to work right.

As a special exception to the GNU GPL, you may use and redistribute this
function however you would like (i.e. consider it public domain).

Use by passing two I<absolute> paths, the first being where to symlink files
from, and the second being what directory to symlink them into.

 my $promise = safe_lndir_p('/path/to/symlink', '/where/to/put/symlinks');
 $promise->then(sub ($result) {
    say "success" if $result;
 });

All intervening directories will be created as needed.  In addition, you may
safely run this function again if you only want to catch additional files in
the source directory.

RETURN VALUE: A promise that resolves to a Boolean true (non-zero) if successful,
Boolean false if unsuccessful.

=head2 prune_under_directory_p

Subroutine to delete recursively, everything under the given directory, unless
we're in pretend mode.

Used from L<ksb::BuildSystem> to handle cleaning a build directory.

i.e. the effect is similar to C<rm -r $arg/* $arg/.*>.

Returns a promise resolving to boolean true on success, boolean false on
failure.
