# Module definitions for building KDE Workspace 6

# Usage: Write your own kdesrc-buildrc with only a "global" section
# then include this file, like this:
#
# include extragear/utils/kdesrc-build/kf6-frameworks-build-include
# include extragear/utils/kdesrc-build/kf6-applications-build-include
# (or using full paths)
#
# You can then add additional modules if desired.
#
# This file uses "branch groups" to decide which git branch to use. If you
# want to add your application here please be sure to update
# kde-build-metadata repo's "logical-module-structure". It includes a simple
# tool you can use to validate your change works (or just "kdesrc-build -p
# your-module" and look for the right branch).
