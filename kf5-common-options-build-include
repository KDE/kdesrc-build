# This file should be used for any module options that should be set by default
# for any kdesrc-build users if they build a given module.
#
# Even if the user doesn't use the other kf5-*-build-include files,
# kdesrc-build can find the modules if include-dependencies is set and may need
# to have the right options set to do the right thing.
# See https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=426219

# Set some options that apply only to kactivities, even if already read in as
# part of a module-set. Other modules can have options set in the same way.
