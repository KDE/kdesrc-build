# Experiments

This directory has some outdated experiments with using Docker images of
various Linux distros to help setup a continuous testing infrastructure for
kdesrc-build.

This is more to ensure kdesrc-build is doing the right thing, KDE uses its own
continuous integration and continuous testing framework for code quality.

Unfortunately I've kept running out of time / energy / etc. to finish this but
it shouldn't be very hard to pick up and complete, assuming you can find spare
cycles to do the test builds.
