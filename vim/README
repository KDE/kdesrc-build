This is vim support for kdesrc-build. To use, place ftdetect/kdesrc-buildrc.vim
in your $VIMRUNTIME/ftdetect folder (create the folder if necessary,
$VIMRUNTIME is normally ~/.vim). This detects kdesrc-buildrc files.

Additionally place syntax/kdesrc-buildrc.vim in the $VIMRUNTIME/syntax folder
(again, create if necessary). This allows Vim to properly highlight your
kdesrc-buildrc when it's detected.

Use ":set ft" to see what filetype is detected if it doesn't work.

The highlighting is quite simplistic, many improvements could easily be made for
those with interest and some free time....

NOTE: Kate and kwrite support is included in the "kdesrc-buildrc.xml" file that has
been included and updated with kdesrc-build for years. Improvements to that are
encouraged as well. :)
