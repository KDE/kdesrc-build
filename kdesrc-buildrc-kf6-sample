    # Update your PATH to find Qt6, the install path is changed in its module-set
    # but is ~/qt6 if you use kdesrc-build default, PATH should contain "$HOME/qt6/bin"

    # Where to download source code. By default the build directory and
    # logs will be kept under this directory as well.
    source-dir ~/kde6/src # Make this ~/kde/src if you want to use same repos as KF6

    # Where to perform the build of source code before installation.
    build-dir ~/kde6/build

    # This can be set to a specific value if auto-detection fails.
    # Set to 'auto' to use (the number of detected cores) - 1
    num-cores 4

    # This is the same as above but used for heavyweight modules like
    # qtwebengine, though you can use it for modules yourself. A conservative
    # thumbrule is one core for every 2 GiB of total memory.

    # For CMake modules this configures CMake to use Ninja as the build
    # controller and generate metadata to make editing with Kate easier.

# Uncomment this if you want kdesrc-build to try to install Qt6.  We recommend
# your distribution's Qt6 *development* packages instead though, if recent enough.

# NOTE: You MUST change the path below to include the actual path to your
# kdesrc-build installation.
#include ~/kde6/usr/share/kdesrc-build/qt6-build-include

# Instead of specifying modules here, the current best practice is to refer to
# KF6 module lists maintained with kdesrc-build by the KF6 developers. As new
# modules are added or modified, the kdesrc-build KF6 module list is altered to
# suit, and when you update kdesrc-build you will automatically pick up the
# needed changes.

# NOTE: You MUST change the path below to include the actual path to your
# kdesrc-build installation.
include ~/kde6/usr/share/kdesrc-build/kf6-qt6-build-include

# If you wish to maintain the module list yourself that is possible, simply
# look at the files pointed to above and use the "module-set" declarations that
# they use, with your own changes.

# It is possible to change the options for modules loaded from the file
# included above (since it's not possible to add a module that's already been
# included), e.g.
options kcoreaddons
    make-options -j ${num-cores}
